WordPress Cofounder Matt Mullenweg joined a diverse lineup of speakers, panelists, and workshop leaders who brought fresh perspectives to the open web from across the globe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Set against the vibrant backdrop of Portland — with its iconic bridges, coffee culture, and creative energy — the Sponsor Hall buzzed as companies across the WordPress ecosystem demoed new products, shared insights, and connected with attendees. Each day offered opportunities to refuel with local flavors and international favorites, turning mealtimes into lively hubs of networking and idea-sharing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A Global Gathering in Portland</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>WordCamp US is the annual gathering point for the WordPress community — where collaboration, creativity, and innovation intersect. This year in Portland, the event delivered an expansive program that reached every corner of the ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s what attendees experienced:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Engaging Sessions Across Tracks</strong> – Keynotes, presentations, and discussions explored the evolving web and the role of open source in shaping it.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>A Global Speaker Lineup</strong> – Voices from across continents brought local stories and global visions to the stage.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Wide-Ranging Topics</strong> – From AI in WordPress development to accessibility, design systems, content strategy, education, and case studies of WordPress at scale.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Hands-On Learning Opportunities</strong> – Workshops provided practical takeaways, empowering attendees to apply new skills immediately.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>A Community Built on Collaboration</strong> – Whether contributing code, exploring business strategies, or sharing creative projects, attendees found space to learn, grow, and celebrate open source together.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>New contributors took their first steps into open source, seasoned developers explored cutting-edge AI integrations, and agencies and product teams shared strategies for scaling WordPress to meet modern needs. Beyond the technical, conversations around inclusivity, sustainability, and education underscored WordPress’s role as a tool for empowerment and positive change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In hallways, coffee lines, and evening meetups, attendees found the “hallway track” alive and well, spontaneous moments of connection that often became the most memorable part of the experience. Whether reconnecting with longtime collaborators or meeting someone new, these small interactions reinforced the heart of WordCamp US: a community that thrives on openness, generosity, and shared purpose.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Contributor Day: Collaboration at the Core</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The conference opened on Tuesday, August 26, with a vibrant Contributor Day. Nearly 300 contributors filled the space, including more than 120 first-time participants who were onboarded across 19 teams. Developers, designers, translators, marketers, and community organizers worked side by side, representing WordPress expertise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Throughout the day, contributors tackled everything from improving accessibility and performance to refining documentation to enhancing translation tools. Beyond technical contributions, teams like Marketing and Community focused on outreach, mentoring, and shaping future-facing initiatives. Remote participants joined via dedicated channels, reinforcing the inclusive nature of WordPress’s global community. By day’s end, the collective energy was clear: WordPress continues to be built by and for everyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped

First-time contributors were paired with seasoned table leads who guided them through their first steps into open source contribution. Longtime contributors reconnected with their teams and advanced ongoing initiatives, while new voices added fresh perspectives and momentum. The spirit of mentorship was woven throughout, ensuring that Contributor Day was productive and welcoming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The results spoke for themselves:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Polyglots</strong> translated more than 12,000 strings, expanding WordPress’s accessibility worldwide.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The <strong>Community team</strong> celebrated the approval of two brand-new local meetups.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The <strong>Training team</strong> achieved its objective of updating outdated course thumbnails.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The <strong>Core team</strong> worked through a live bug scrub, with 9 committers and 16 contributors collaborating on improvements.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The <strong>Documentation team</strong> completed numerous content updates to keep resources fresh and reliable.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Momentum carried through every table, with participants reporting measurable progress and a renewed sense of shared purpose. Contributor Day once again highlighted the unique power of collaboration in shaping the open web, proving that every contribution matters through code, translations, training, or community building.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Showcase Day: WordPress in Action</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Wednesday, August 27, was the popular Showcase Day, spotlighting real-world innovation in WordPress. Initially expected to draw about 250 participants, Showcase Day welcomed more than 800 attendees — a powerful sign of how much energy and curiosity the community brought to Portland. The sessions demonstrated how WordPress powers meaningful work across industries from nonprofits to newsrooms, agencies to global enterprises, while staying true to open source values.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The day opened with a keynote by Amy Sample Ward: <em>The Tech That Comes Next</em>. Drawing from their co-authored book with Afua Bruce, Amy highlighted the inequities embedded in today’s technologies — from dataset bias to accessibility gaps — and challenged attendees to rethink how tools are funded, built, and deployed. Their talk invited technologists, funders, and community leaders to imagine a more equitable digital future, rooted in collaboration and shared responsibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"WordCamp US 2025 - Amy Sample Ward &quot;The Tech That Comes Next&quot;\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/RKnM75GFZxw?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>From there, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/PGvh7fCOUk0\">Joeleen Kennedy</a> of Human Made shared how Full Site Editing (FSE) shapes the refresh of Wikimedia’s ongoing user experience. Her session <em>Modernizing at Scale</em> detailed how FSE is simplifying workflows, improving accessibility, and making the multilingual platform more sustainable for the long term. Attendees gained a behind-the-scenes look at how one of the world’s largest open knowledge platforms is leveraging WordPress innovation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/F4NEPcwGRCI\">Josh Bryant</a> took the stage to explore what happens when Gutenberg leaves the WP-Admin dashboard. His talk, <em>Reimagining WordPress Editing</em>, walked through embedding the block editor into a standalone React application to support Dow Jones’s newsroom workflows. From decoupling Gutenberg to managing custom data stores, the session showcased advanced techniques for scaling editorial tools while maintaining the flexibility of the WordPress ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hands-on learning was a hallmark of Showcase Day, with Jamie Marsland’s workshop leading participants through building and launching their own professional portfolio sites — no coding required. Attendees left with a fully functioning site, demonstrating WordPress’s continued ability to empower anyone, anywhere, to publish online.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the afternoon, Jeffrey Paul’s session <em>Scalable, Ethical AI</em> addressed one of the most pressing topics in today’s digital world: how to integrate AI without sacrificing ownership, privacy, or open standards. Walking participants through practical use cases with ClassifAI and local LLMs, Paul emphasized how WordPress can help content creators harness AI while maintaining autonomy over their data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The day closed with a forward-looking community highlight: <a href=\"https://events.wordpress.org/campusconnect/\">WordPress Campus Connect</a>. Panelists <a href=\"https://youtu.be/ARqM9U0ESvo\">Destiny Kanno, Andrés Parra, Javier Montes de Blas, Mauricio Barrantes, and Elineth Morera Campos</a> shared how this initiative brings WordPress into classrooms and universities worldwide. Student Andrés Parra received a scholarship to attend WordCamp. During the panel, Elineth also announced that Fidélitas University will begin offering its students a <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2025/07/introducing-wordpress-credits-a-new-contribution-internship-program-for-university-students/\">WordPress Credits</a> program starting in October 2025, making it a mandatory addition sometime in 2026, enabling them to contribute directly to WordPress as part of their studies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By connecting students and educators with the open web, Campus Connect is building the next generation of contributors and innovators, ensuring that WordPress remains both a learning tool and a pathway to opportunity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taken together, Showcase Day affirmed that WordPress is more than just a CMS — it is a platform for equitable technology, global collaboration, cutting-edge enterprise solutions, and the future of digital education. WordPress has the power to be both a platform and a community tool for education, equity, and innovation.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Presentation Days: Learning, Inspiration, and Connection</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The first full day of sessions at WordCamp US 2025 opened with warm remarks from the organizing team, who reminded attendees: <em>“The most important thanks goes to all of you. The mix of new energy and veteran experience is what makes WordCamp so special, so thank you for being here.”</em> That spirit of gratitude and community carried throughout the event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Sponsor Hall became a hub of activity, complete with raffles, the return of Career Corner, and even a Voodoo Donut Truck parked outside. Attendees lined up to test their luck at a claw machine stuffed with plush Wapuus, while others sought guidance at the Happiness Bar — a hands-on help desk for WordPress questions big and small. Between these activities, the steady buzz of conversations made it clear: the “hallway track” remained one of WordCamp’s most valuable experiences.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"WordCamp US - Danny Sullivan &quot;How (and why!) Google Search Keeps Evolving&quot;\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZF_sxLdfTbY?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The program itself set a high bar. Danny Sullivan’s keynote shed light on how search has evolved to meet the needs of new generations, from 24/7 demand and mobile expectations to short-form video and AI. His session gave attendees a deeper understanding of how search intersects with publishing today and sparked conversations about how WordPress can continue adapting in an era where AI shapes discovery and content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From there, the schedule unfolded across multiple tracks. The Core AI panel — featuring <a href=\"https://youtu.be/v_0O6dQ4Q4E\">James LePage, Felix Arntz, and Jeffrey Paul</a> — offered a look into how AI tools are woven into WordPress core. Emphasizing ethics, transparency, and user empowerment, the panel painted a roadmap for how WordPress can adopt new technologies without compromising its open-source values.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2025/08/Programming-Day-1-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-19103\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2025/08/Programming-Day-1-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2025/08/Programming-Day-1-2.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2025/08/Programming-Day-1-2.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2025/08/Programming-Day-1-2.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2025/08/Programming-Day-1-2.jpg?w=1600&amp;ssl=1 1600w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Hands-on learning played a significant role throughout the conference. Ryan Welcher’s interactive <em>Block Developer Cookbook</em> drew a packed room as participants worked through community-selected code recipes built on the latest WordPress APIs. By the end, attendees left with working examples and practical strategies they could bring back to their projects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The program also highlighted diverse technical perspectives. <a href=\"https://youtu.be/vBjNqdacbh4\">Jemima Abu’s</a> session, <em>A PHP Developer’s Guide to ReactJS</em>, bridged the gap between classic and modern web development. At the same time, Adam Gazzaley’s keynote, <em>A New Era of Experiential Medicine – AI and the Brain</em>, invited attendees to consider the human side of technology, exploring how digital tools can advance health and well-being.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second day of presentations, Friday, August 29, opened with creativity and imagination. <a href=\"https://youtu.be/O7FPiFpRI3o\">John Maeda’s</a> keynote, <em>Cozy AI Cooking: WordCamp Edition</em>, used the metaphor of a kitchen to demystify AI, blending storytelling with technical insight to show how curiosity and care can guide builders in integrating AI into their work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Later in the day, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/ORnJTpjA-4w\">Tammie Lister’s</a> <em>The System is the Strategy</em> illustrated how design systems provide structure and scalability for growing WordPress projects. At the same time, Adam Silverstein’s Unlock Developer Superpowers with AI showcased new ways developers can use emerging tools to speed up workflows and problem-solving.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Community stories also took center stage. In Creators around a Campfire, Anne McCarthy, Jamie Marsland, Christian Taylor, Mark Szymanski, and Michael Cunningham reflected on how YouTubers and content creators shape the WordPress ecosystem. Their session highlighted the role of storytelling and education in expanding WordPress’s reach to new audiences worldwide.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Sponsor Hall remained lively between sessions — with attendees meeting companies, testing demos, and swapping ideas that extended far beyond the conference halls. They also shared moments together at the arcade built for the event and added smiles, hugs, and laughter, which underscored the atmosphere: WordCamp US was as much about connection as code.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Together Into the Future</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As the event drew to a close, WordPress Cofounder Matt Mullenweg took the stage to share the current state of WordPress and a vision for its future. He highlighted the growth in social media for WordPress with 124,726 new followers since last WCUS — and the WordPress.org website growing over 10% in users along with almost 20% in new users. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matt also spotlighted community initiatives shaping the future of open source education and diversity: WordPress Campus Connect, which has already reached 570 students across 11 events. Combined with the growth in overall events (77) which is a 32.76% increase over 2024. Each effort reinforced the message that WordPress is more than software; it is a global movement driven by people.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"WordCamp US 2025 - Ma.tt Mullenweg &quot;Keynote Address &amp; Q&amp;A&quot;\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/45HRzzc0waU?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>He concluded with a live Q&amp;A, fielding questions from the audience on the direction of WordPress, its role in an AI-driven web, and the importance of keeping the project open, inclusive, and adaptable. The final notes of the keynote carried into a closing party in downtown Portland, where attendees capped off the week with music, conversation, and the unmistakable joy of a community coming together.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Closing</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>WordCamp US 2025 once again demonstrated what makes the WordPress ecosystem extraordinary: a community committed to building tools, resources, and opportunities that empower people everywhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This year also marked the debut of the <a href=\"https://airtable.com/appWF6hdXuEOFQMvV/shrV5RZIv0aJjjU00\">Open Horizons Scholarship</a>, which funded six recipients — two organizers, three volunteers, and one speaker — from five countries. A total of $14,670 supported their journeys to WCUS. The scholarship, which also supports participation at WordCamp Asia and WordCamp Europe, is designed to make flagship events more accessible to contributors worldwide.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A heartfelt thank you goes to the organizers, volunteers, sponsors, and speakers who brought the Portland edition to life — and to every attendee who joined us in person or followed along online. We hope you leave with fresh ideas, meaningful connections, and renewed energy to help shape the future of the open web.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default

For more information on this release, please <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/wordpress-version/version-6-8-2\">visit the HelpHub version page</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Dropping security updates for WordPress versions 4.1 through 4.6</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This is not directly related to the 6.8.2 maintenance release, but <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2025/06/dropping-security-updates-for-wordpress-versions-4-1-through-4-6/\">branches 4.1 to 4.6 had their final release today</a>. These branches won&#8217;t receive any security update anymore.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Thank you to these WordPress contributors</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.8.2 was led by <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/audrasjb/\">Jb Audras</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/estelaris/\">Estela Rueda</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/zunaid321/\">Zunaid Amin</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Special thanks to <a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/davidbaumwald/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>davidbaumwald</a>, <a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/sergeybiryukov/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>sergeybiryukov</a>, <a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/mamaduka/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>mamaduka</a>, <a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/wildworks/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>wildworks</a> and <a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/jorbin/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>jorbin</a> for their help on specific release tasks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.8.2 would not have been possible without the contributions of the following 96 people.

While WordPress thrives on contributions from a global volunteer community, many students and newcomers face barriers to entry, such as a lack of structured guidance or real-world experience in open source projects. This new program is designed to bridge that gap, nurturing future contributors and ensuring WordPress remains innovative, inclusive, and sustainable for years to come.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://gamma.app/docs/EN-WordPress-Credits-vz0k2vr1ulg91qq?mode=doc\">pilot program</a>, developed in partnership with the University of Pisa, was announced on stage at WordCamp Europe 2025 by Matt Mullenweg and Mary Hubbard. Since then, it has attracted interest from students across various fields of study, including humanities, computer science, and communication. Companies in the WordPress ecosystem have also expressed support and interest in contributing to the project. In response to the growing interest from both community members and academic institutions, we are now inviting more universities to join the initiative.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Open to students from all fields of study, the program blends structured onboarding with a personalized contribution project. Activities are adapted to each student’s degree program and familiarity with WordPress, aiming to develop transferable skills, academic-related competencies, and active participation in the WordPress community. Internship durations may vary depending on the university or educational institution. Some may align with academic semesters (typically 3–4 months), while others, like the University of Pisa, allow students to sign up year-round with a requirement to complete a set number of contribution hours (e.g. 150 hours). Flexible arrangements can be discussed to meet the specific requirements of each institution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Foundational Training includes:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>An introduction to open source principles and the WordPress Foundation</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Getting familiar with community tools (Slack, Make blogs, Learn platform, GitHub)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Setting up a personal WordPress site and publishing content</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Each student will choose a contribution area and design their own personal project within that area. Examples of possible projects include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Translating interfaces or documentation</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Creating multilingual subtitles for educational videos</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Contributing code or performing testing</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Supporting product development or design</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Writing or editing content</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Assisting with community event organization</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Developing training materials for Learn WordPress</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Creating open source tools</li>\n\n\n\n<li>And much more…<br></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Interns are guided by an experienced mentor specific to their chosen area and supported by a dedicated WordPress Foundation contact person throughout the program. All student contributions, whether code, translations, documentation, or educational materials, will be publicly visible and integrated into official WordPress projects and resources, directly benefiting the wider community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Interested universities and educational institutions</strong> interested in participating can reach out by filling <a href=\"https://airtable.com/appIzQKfwTn5dyPVp/shrYvY0CDNIkILIre\">the interest form</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also invite companies in the WordPress ecosystem to support this initiative by sponsoring mentors who will guide and empower the next generation of contributors, or by providing tools and resources that help students succeed in their contribution journey.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>If your company is interested in getting involved</strong>, please visit the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/handbook/wordpress-credits-contribution-internship-program/get-involved-company-guide/\">Company Guide</a> to learn more and <a href=\"https://airtable.com/appIzQKfwTn5dyPVp/shrKDkjeUdw8Fof34\">fill out the form</a> to join the program.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>By welcoming students, mentors, sponsors, and volunteers into this initiative, we are building a stronger and more connected WordPress community. Each person who takes part, whether they guide a student, share their experiences, provide sponsorship, or simply help spread the word, helps ensure that open source remains vibrant and accessible for all.

It was followed by two days of engaging talks, panels, hands-on workshops, and vibrant community connections. WordPress Cofounder Matt Mullenweg and Executive Director Mary Hubbard joined a diverse lineup of speakers and panelists, sharing insights in the heart of one of Europe’s most charming cities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Set against the backdrop of Basel’s historic streets and Rhine-side views, the sponsor hall buzzed with activity as companies from across the WordPress ecosystem showcased their latest innovations, offered live demos, and connected with attendees. Each day, participants refueled with a range of local and international cuisine — from Swiss specialties to global favorites — making mealtime a lively space for networking, collaboration, and sparking new ideas.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A Global Gathering in Basel</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>WordCamp Europe has long been one of the most anticipated WordPress events of the year — a space where community, creativity, and collaboration thrive.

Guided by 33 dedicated table leads, with 21 teams, attendees of all experience levels came together to exchange ideas, solve real challenges, and make meaningful contributions to open source.

range of teams, from Core and Accessibility to Polyglots, Training, and Community. Attendees tackled everything from onboarding and ticket triage to translating strings, improving documentation, and enhancing tools and workflows. Development-focused teams explored performance and testing improvements and worked through live coding exercises. Meanwhile, accessibility testers, support volunteers, and photo moderators contributed to efforts that directly impact users around the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In parallel, teams like Marketing, Meta, Hosting, and Sustainability focused on future-facing initiatives—from promoting WordPress through the Showcase and social media campaigns to refining infrastructure, increasing accessibility, and preparing for long-term project growth. Whether contributing to plugins, themes, documentation, or new contributor experiences, participants reinforced the values that power the WordPress project: collaboration, inclusivity, and openness. The day served as a reminder that WordPress is not just software—it’s a community built by and for everyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Tomorrow Starts with WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The first full day of WordCamp Europe 2025 brought the community together to celebrate the power of open source collaboration and innovation. Opening remarks from both global and local event leads reflected on the journey of WordCamp Europe—from its beginnings in 2013 in Leiden, Netherlands, to the vibrant event in Basel today. This full-circle moment underscored the growth of the WordPress community, united by a shared commitment to an open web.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The day launched into an inspiring program with the keynote session, <em>WordPress Without Borders – The Fight for Digital Freedom</em>, delivered by Noel Tock. Drawing from his experiences—including time on the frontlines in Ukraine—Tock illustrated how open source supports global resilience and serves as a digital human right. His message called on contributors to see their work as part of something greater, offering a compelling and forward-looking vision to energize and unify the WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"WordPress without Borders — The Fight for Digital Freedom | Noel Tock\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/tb_A-ABehnY?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>From there, the program unfolded across multiple tracks—each one sparking new conversations and insights. One standout session highlighted social entrepreneurship in Bulgaria, where WordPress is helping grassroots organizations drive change in education, journalism, and social justice. Petya Raykovska shared how nonprofits like Teenovator and the Bulgarian Fund for Women are using WordPress to amplify their work and strengthen their communities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Designers and developers explored ways to improve workflows and collaboration. In <em>Bridging Design and Development</em>, attendees learned how Figma Design Systems can connect design and development through shared structures mapped to block themes. Real-world examples, like the Novus Media Newspaper Design System, demonstrated how scalable, consistent design can power multi-brand platforms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Workshops played a key role throughout the day, including the interactive <em>Block Developer Cookbook: WCEU 2025 Edition</em>, where attendees worked through community-voted code recipes featuring the latest WordPress APIs. Sessions also dove into emerging technologies, such as <em>Automating WordPress Setup with Modern AI Tools</em>, which showcased how WP-CLI, scripting, and AI can accelerate project setup and reduce repetitive tasks.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2025/06/54571048139_5009fd3c2b_k.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-18817\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2025/06/54571048139_5009fd3c2b_k.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2025/06/54571048139_5009fd3c2b_k.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2025/06/54571048139_5009fd3c2b_k.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2025/06/54571048139_5009fd3c2b_k.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2025/06/54571048139_5009fd3c2b_k.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Photo by Marc Wieland</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Day Two of WordCamp Europe 2025 opened with a focus on the evolving role of the WordPress community in a rapidly changing digital world. Sessions explored how contributors—from local meetup organizers to global advocates—play a vital part in shaping WordPress’s future. Talks on inclusivity, such as <em>Over the Rainbow</em>, encouraged attendees to consider how individual actions can help build a more welcoming, representative open source ecosystem. Throughout the morning, the spirit of collaboration and shared purpose remained front and center.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the day progressed, attention turned to the tools and technologies pushing WordPress forward. From sessions on scaling multilingual sites and managing observability to hands-on workshops, developers explored new ways to streamline workflows and enhance performance. Highlights included <em>WordPress Gems for Devs</em>, which introduced the Interactivity API through live coding, and <em>Client-side Web AI Agents</em>, a look at cutting-edge browser-based AI that unlocks new possibilities for web experiences. These talks reflected the platform’s growing capacity to adapt to emerging trends while staying true to its open foundations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The afternoon brought a blend of practical guidance and inspiring stories across tracks. A case study on accessibility from Switzerland showed how thoughtful design can benefit all users, while a session on brand-building for women entrepreneurs highlighted the creative and economic opportunities WordPress enables. With topics spanning content strategy, business growth, regulatory readiness, and more, the second day of WCEU 2025 affirmed the strength of the WordPress ecosystem—not only as a technology platform, but as a global movement fueled by people, purpose, and possibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Fireside Chat</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As the final day drew to a close, Matt and Mary shared some thoughts on EU regulation (Open Web Alliance), AI, and the introduction of the WordPress AI team, and then answered questions from the audience.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Fireside chat with Q&amp;A | Mary Hubbard and Matt Mullenweg\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/mzJwYejWUbY?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Closing</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A heartfelt thank you to the dedicated organizers who brought WordCamp Europe 2025 to life in Basel, the speakers who shared their insights, the attendees who joined us in person, and those who followed along from afar.

This team provides a central place to collaborate, share ideas, and build together.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Rapid iteration</strong>: Like the Performance Team, we’ll take a plugin-first approach. <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/09/11/canonical-plugins-revisited/\">Canonical Plugins</a> will allow us to move quickly, gather feedback, and deliver real value without waiting on the Core release cycle.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What to Expect</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The AI Team will:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Coordinate cross-team efforts to explore AI-powered features responsibly and inclusively.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Publish and maintain a public roadmap of AI initiatives and Canonical Plugins.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Collaborate closely with Core, Design, Accessibility, and other teams to ensure strong integration and shared standards.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Meet the Team</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The WordPress AI Team brings deep experience in open-source, performance, and product development and a strong commitment to building AI features the WordPress way. The team will launch with the following team contributors:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>James LePage</strong> – Automattic</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Felix Arntz</strong> – Google</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Pascal Birchler</strong> – Google</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Jeff Paul</strong> – 10up</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>To help get things started, James and Felix will serve as the initial <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/updates/team-reps/\">Team Reps</a> in supporting team organization, communication, and coordination with other Make WordPress teams.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is an exciting and important step in WordPress’s evolution.

Businesses, too! I used to get laughed out of the room or had spears thrown at the security of open source, but that is no longer a blocker, and the conversation has really elevated. It doesn&#8217;t feel like one person raising their hand anymore; it&#8217;s grown into a truly special movement, a lens through which you can view almost anything.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Open source is the best way we have to set the foundation for future generations to build upon, ensuring the light cone of humanity&#8217;s technological expansion becomes something that belongs to all of us, not just a few.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sun, 07 Sep 2025 19:08:56 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"Matt\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:1;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:21:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:19:\"Matt: Breaking Ribs\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:23:\"https://ma.tt/?p=149695\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:36:\"https://ma.tt/2025/09/breaking-ribs/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1959:\"<p><span style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px;\"><a href=\"https://chrisyoungcooks.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Chris Young</a>, who is otherwise famous for being a <a href=\"https://modernistcuisine.com/books/modernist-cuisine/\" target=\"_blank\">co-author of the 2,438-page cookbook Modernist Cuisine</a> or <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/s8OcZYCBaOo\" target=\"_blank\">centrifuging steaks and drinking them</a>, is one of the friends who, over the years, has told me I have to watch <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breaking_Bad\" target=\"_blank\">Breaking Bad</a>, the TV show.</span> When I was in Marrakech for a few weeks earlier this year, and it was a million degrees outside, I cracked and started watching, and I see why people say it&#8217;s one of the best shows ever.

If you live at the intersection of Breaking Bad, BBQ, science, chemistry, and cooking, this is the video for you.

In today&#8217;s episode we will talk about WordCamp US, Telex, Gutenberg 21.4 and 5 and also we will discuss that we need more blocks. Maybe. I&#8217;m your host Birgit Pauli-Haack, curator at the Gutenberg Times and WordPress developer advocate and full-time core contributor for the WordPress open source project sponsored by Automattic. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And after a long break, Sarah Norris joins me again. Yay. She is a co-core team rep, a core contributor to the Goodwill Project, and developer and designer working for Automattic. Thank you so much for taking the time and coming onto the show again. Sarah, how are you today? And maybe you can briefly outline what you have been working on for what might be coming to WordPress 6.9.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Sarah Norris:</em> Yeah, sure. Yeah. Hello. It has been a really long time. It&#8217;s good to be back. Yeah, I&#8217;m good. I&#8217;m looking forward to autumn, my favorite time of year. So for 6.9 I&#8217;ve mostly been working on new blocks. Yes, all the new blocks. I&#8217;ve been working on the Accordion block, which was called Accordions but is now called Accordion Singular. Also I&#8217;ve been looking over the new tabs block. There&#8217;s a PR going for that that I&#8217;m really interested in, looking at maybe getting the table of contents block stabilized as well. I think there&#8217;s a lot of work to do there, but I think it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s quite well rounded, well outlined so we can get stuck in there. And then I&#8217;ve also been working on a new terms query block as well. So that&#8217;s it&#8217;s like the query loop block but for taxonomies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Wow, it sounds exciting. Awesome. Awesome. So you&#8217;re the right person to talk about. We need more blocks later on so we&#8217;re coming to the announcements. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Announcements</h3>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Automattic Telex</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So at his keynote at WordCamp US, Matt Mullenweg, you probably heard it all already, dear listeners announced experimental AI tool called Telex, and it can be used to build new blocks with a plain English language prompt so you don&#8217;t have to speak code. So try it out. I&#8217;ll share the links in the show notes. And Ray Mori from the repository has quite done a good rundown of all the reactions for Telex on Twitter and all that. So I&#8217;m going to share this with you. But it&#8217;s a really exciting tool and it&#8217;s also experimental, so it might not have the outcome that you want, but you might get new ideas from it. So have you tried it out, Sarah?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Sarah Norris:</em> Yes. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Sarah Norris: </em>I&#8217;ve been following the development closely and trying it out. It&#8217;s amazing. It&#8217;s so much fun to use. Yeah. Definitely recommend people try it out. You might not get what you expect, but I don&#8217;t know if you ever do with AI, it&#8217;s all about what you put into it, isn&#8217;t it? And see what you get. Especially for new blocks. People should try it to build new blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>So did you build a new block?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Sarah Norris: </em>I built a few ideas, like a few silly things. I haven&#8217;t tried it on any new core blocks yet. Maybe that&#8217;s the. The next step. Maybe I should try it on all these new core blocks we&#8217;ve got coming up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>Well, but I&#8217;m more interested in the silly things than the crazy things or in the quirky things. But did you try?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Sarah Norris: </em>What did I try? I&#8217;ve tried like some random image generators, just like some random color stuff as well. Trying like different colors, different patterns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Sarah Norris:</em> Maybe I should add some to the new live tool so we can get them in the library.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>There&#8217;s a library maybe coming up. Okay, well, it&#8217;s the next current step. Yeah. Kind of thinking about, okay, if so many people build blocks and we want to kind of showcase all those ideas, if they&#8217;re ready enough so other people can use them, then you probably want to have a site for that. That&#8217;s totally true. Yeah, true. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">WordCamp US</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyway, so speaking of WordCamp viewers, the talks are almost all uploaded to WordPress TV, so the team is really amazing. And there were fantastic talks at the showcase day as well as the other days. And we had about a dozen talks about AI in all kinds of flavors. And I only want to kind of point out three of them. One was for developers. Adam Silverstein’s talk Unlock Developer Superpowers with AI is definitely worth a look on the rerun as he tested quite a few new tools and also gave a great rundown on his approach and how he works with it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So Adam is a former Googler and he is a core committer on the WordPress project. So yeah, he&#8217;s definitely out there ahead of, well, at least me. I don&#8217;t know about Sarah, but definitely ahead of me, so. And for nondevelopers, John Maeda’s talk was a fantastic introduction in how to think about AI in his cozy AI cooking talk as a keynote on the third day. And then if you want to be amazed of what&#8217;s happening in other areas outside of development, but in other areas of science, I highly recommend Professor Adam Gazzaley’s talk on the new era of experimental medicine, AI and the brain. And he talks about how his lab at the University of San Francisco did a lot of brain testing and figured out a way to replicate and have a feedback loop, a close feedback loop to reactions on certain things. So and what they actually did was they created a video game to help people with ADHD. And that&#8217;s for prescription, but also available for adults who are kind of having a bit of a cognitive decline in the later years and want to kind of keep a stop to that or at least delay it. So it&#8217;s really an interesting talk. Totally not related to WordPress at all. So yeah, have you watched any of those talks?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Sarah Norris: </em>I haven&#8217;t this week. I&#8217;ve been concentrating on basically building the terms query block. But all three of these I really want to watch. They sound really good, especially that last one that sounds super interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>Yeah, yeah, the resources that he mentions in his slide deck and all that, you can really kind of go down that rabbit hole on a Sunday afternoon and kind of learn more about that. And then for block and block related talks, there were so many and each covering a different angle. I have a list in my Weekend Edition 38 that I would kind of where I said I would want to watch it and even if I&#8217;m not getting into the talk, I will keep a list of that for the reruns. But if I wanted also three of them is one is Michelle Hunt’s Building Experiences, Design systems, User experience and full site editing. And she really brings it home in talking about Atomic Design, which was a topic two years ago in San Diego or three years ago even, and then applying it to WordPress and themes and blocks and also creating a design system as well as guardrails for users. That&#8217;s her user experience piece that if you have too many options you confuse users and they don&#8217;t need them, but you can build guardrails around it and curate the experience quite well. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mary Ann Aschenbrenner is from a small agency and she talked about how she moved websites from classic theme to a block theme and what the steps were involved. And yeah, some decision making process there, really good. And then Block Composability the Past and the Future with Seth Rubenstein and Max Schmeling, and they talked about the remote data block coming out of WordPress VIP and they open sourced it, and that is how you can connect the Gutenberg editor with an outside data source like Google Spreadsheets or Airtable and bring that data in live. So when it changed the data on the other sites. Yeah, it&#8217;s updated the website and use block bindings and interactivity API to pull it all into a page and blocks that you can put on a page. So it&#8217;s really interesting what comes out of that this year in WordCamp US. So have you looked at the remote data block yet?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Sarah Norris: </em>No, I haven&#8217;t, but that sounds amazing. It almost sounds like zapier but. But for. For the editor. Yeah, that sounds really cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>Yeah, that was the idea about it, that you don&#8217;t have to create blocks for that. You kind of use that one block. Yeah, that has a lot of tools in there and then you can pull them in. It&#8217;s really interesting. So yeah, but of course everyone is at a different stage in their blocks journey, and it&#8217;s difficult to recommend a talk without knowing more about the needs but so I will share in the notes the link to all the talks of WordCamp US. I think right now they have two or three pages already uploaded so you can kind of look at them but don&#8217;t forget it and let times go past. It might also be something to put on your list for Christmas vacation days or Thanksgiving days instead of other things maybe. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Community Contributions</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So what&#8217;s community contributions? It seems there&#8217;s more new Momentum at the WordPress Developer Blog because apart from the What&#8217;s New for Developers by Justin Tadlock, there were four more articles published since we had our last Gutenberg Changelog recording, and two of them are by Justin Tadlock. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>One is a little controversial as a stated title, you don&#8217;t need Theme JSON for block theme styles. When you want to need or step away from using theme JSON for styling themes, this guide will walk you through the best practices of using style sheets instead. You will also learn from the article that Justin actually really likes theme JSON, but he wants to pick you up where you are and if you don&#8217;t don&#8217;t have a real good handle on it yet, you have alternatives and options. And the second one is in view of what&#8217;s coming to WordPress 6.9 is registering custom social icons for Gutenberg, and it&#8217;s a new filter hook that&#8217;s coming to the next release, and it&#8217;s learn how to use it to register your own services for social icons block. So his example is IMDb, that&#8217;s the movie database or Ko Fi, that&#8217;s buy me some coffee kind of donation place. I used it for my next edition of the Gutenberg Times theme where I want to have an archive page for my podcast, and I needed the icons for all the podcast directories where you can find the Gutenberg Changelog because only Spotify was on there, and there are so many others that are there, so. And Pocket Cast is already in there, but all the others are not. So I built them with that new tool for my new plugin. So it&#8217;s really interesting. So if you have other needs, you can do it yourself. You don&#8217;t need to wait for Core to put them in. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And Troy Chaplin also he published a series on refactoring a multiblock plugin to build smarter register cleaner and scale easier. So if you have a multi block plugin, it&#8217;s kind of gives it a cleaner structure, support all block types and also a smarter registration and bundling of your assets. I think it&#8217;s a very good tutorial for the next stage of your plugins. And he also has a second post in the same realm is about implementing namespaces and coding standards in WordPress plugin development. This post got a lot of comments and suggestions from other people, co-developers and others. So it&#8217;s definitely worth looking into because namespacing, auto loading and linting for your multi block plugin is definitely something you want to find out or how to do this. So shout out for both authors for taking the time to put those tutorials together for other WordPress developers. And dear listeners, make sure you never miss another post of the developer block again. Subscribe to the blog. Anyway, I&#8217;m not asking you, I&#8217;m not putting on the spot when you&#8217;re gonna write for the developer blog. But yeah, think about it. We&#8217;re open to ideas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Sarah Norris: </em>I&#8217;ll have a think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Say again?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Sarah Norris:</em> I&#8217;ll have a think.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What’s Released &#8211; Gutenberg 21.4</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>Yeah, have a think. So, which brings us dear listeners to the Gutenberg releases in the last four weeks. We are starting with Gutenberg 21.4. Do you want to get us started, Sarah?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Sarah Norris: </em>Yes. Yeah. Okay. Okay. What we&#8217;ve got first for 21.4. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Enhancements</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So in enhancements we&#8217;ve got a new server side render hook.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>Yeah. And I&#8217;ve put some question marks on it because I need you to explain it to me a bit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Sarah Norris: </em>I mean, I&#8217;m not sure I can do that. So I think this is a. It&#8217;s a really nice refactoring job. So we had. Well, we still do have some data fetching logic in a server side render function and this has been refactored into a hook called useserverside Render, and it basically gives consumers more control over the block content when they&#8217;re using the server side rendering technique. I think we did have this functionality before, but this makes it much easier and more flexible for consumers to absorb the block content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>All right, so when you say consumers, you mean extenders who use it in their block plugin, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Sarah Norris: </em>Yes, yeah, that&#8217;s right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>Yeah. It&#8217;s not me as a consumer of Nutella or something.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Sarah Norris: </em>Nutella Hook though, would be amazing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>That&#8217;s a new blog.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Sarah Norris: </em>Use Nutella.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>Use the Teleservice. No. Oh, what a mess. So we have quite a few things that are concerning the data views. It gets a real good polish now and some great features in there. So the first thing is that there is a control command plus click for multiselection in the table layout. When you have data views in a table. So you can click all the rows that you want to use for bulk edits or something like that, which is really cool. It&#8217;s also a feature that is in the old WP admin. The second one is the data form select box to have custom empty options. This is actually really cool because then you have a no selection and it doesn&#8217;t disrupt anything of the workflow. Yeah, I got this all my life of web development and forms that when you have a dropdown you need an empty one. So if it&#8217;s not a required field. So they can unselect things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Sarah Norris: </em>Yeah, Very easily forgotten because how often do you actually build dropdowns as well? So every time you build one it&#8217;s good. Oh yeah, I need an empty option.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>Yeah. It&#8217;s now built in to have a custom empty option if you want it. You want to do the next.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Sarah Norris: </em>Yeah. What&#8217;s the next one? So I&#8217;ve got support group by in the table layout. So this, this is adding support for the table to be grouped by field, isn&#8217;t it? So it means that when you&#8217;re viewing a table, it can be grouped into separate sections and each section will have a heading. Yeah. But I guess depending on the content, it makes it much easier to consume that content and then. Yeah, each section has a table row with a heading. Yeah, that helps separate it out. Nice and neat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>Yeah, it makes it a little bit easier to find all the stuff that you need. The next one is that it&#8217;s now use responsive images for the dataview grid layout. So if you&#8217;re on a tablet, the images are smaller so you get more things on the screen as well as the mobile. You can use that in mobile as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Sarah Norris: </em>Yeah, yeah. I didn&#8217;t know about this PR actually. It&#8217;s very, very cool because it&#8217;s. It allows you to to pass a maximum width to the images in the grid view. Because I think previously it was using the largest image or one of the largest image sizes. But that means like if there were a lot of images, this is saving like literal megabytes on every grid view. So that&#8217;s. It&#8217;s really, really cool. Good, Good pr. Good performance. PP.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>Yeah, absolutely. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Sarah Norris: </em>Next one is allow data views empty state to be customized. Oh yeah. So this is if. So if you&#8217;re like loading a data views component, if there were no results previously, I think it just would render just a white screen basically, which is an empty data view component. But this allows you to pass in like a default empty state. So if you&#8217;re listing pages and no pages are part of the search results, then you can add something like a no pages found message. But it&#8217;ll be styled nicely and be centered and will look much better UX than a blank screen, basically.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>Then nothing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Sarah Norris: </em>Yeah, yeah, then nothing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>Yeah. And I also like the. The last one is a data form is now a bootstrap validation for required and type checks on the input. And that&#8217;s right now for text input, email, integer and boolean field types. Boolean. Yeah, I never knows how to pronounce it. How do you pronounce it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Sarah Norris: </em>Boolean.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>Boolean. Boolean. Boolean. Yeah. Other people say boolean. Anyway. Yeah, I really like that. So now you can have your data forms automatically kind of validated and at least for those types I think more is coming there as well. So yeah, if you use the data views for your plugins, you can actually have now good user input handling as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Sarah Norris: </em>Next is the block library section and then we have the cover video block Add drag and drop support for poster uploads. So this is so for videos you can add a poster image for HTML videos. And this basically just allows drag and drop functionality. So we can drag these images into the poster section when you&#8217;re editing the cover video block basically makes it much easier to add a poster.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>Yeah, yeah. Drag and drop is always fun most of the time. Yeah. And it&#8217;s not only for the video block, but it&#8217;s also for the cover block that has that video that&#8217;s also then pulled in. If there is not enough bandwidth on the page to show a poster instead of the video, and only when you click on it, the video kind of plays. And then we have updates to the file block. Two of them. One is to use the mime type to determine if a file is a PDF and the other one is have the nature of Feature detection for PDF support. So that would also give the PDF support means have it embedded on the page as an option or also have thumbnails and all that kind of thing. So yeah, those are kind of great enhancements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Sarah Norris:</em> Next up is the block editor section. So we have the list add keyboard shortcuts to indent, outdate, outdent. So this adds a keyboard shortcut to the tooltips. Why can&#8217;t I say tooltips? All these words that you don&#8217;t have to say out loud. And then you&#8217;re forcing me to say. When you hover over the block toolbar for the list block, you&#8217;ll now get some helpful tool tips that tell you about the indent and tab keyboard shortcuts. Basically.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>Yeah, yeah, it&#8217;s been a while that it actually is the tab to indent on the list block. But it wasn&#8217;t really that widely known because it took a while to get it in there and now you can. On a single list item you can use the tab to indent it. But now you also know it by hovering over the tooltips or getting some tooltips. When you hover over the block toolbar, there is the icon to indent and outdent. And now it also has the tooltip for use the tab dummy kind of thing. All right. Oh, the write mode is also has quite some updates in the last few Gutenberg releases. This one also only has one that it adds the shuffle style to the write mode toolbar on a container block. So if you have a block, if there is a style variations for that particular block, you can you get this little color drop to select those style variations that is actually coming out of the zoom out mode that was already in 6.8.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Sarah Norris: </em>Yeah, it&#8217;s very cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>It&#8217;s totally cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Sarah Norris: </em>Yeah, it makes it really easy to. I know that&#8217;s the whole point of it, but it makes it very easy to switch between the styles. I think it&#8217;s something that we don&#8217;t really think about, especially when you&#8217;re building for the editor as well. But as soon as you see it in action, it&#8217;s just like, oh, this is unlocks loads of functionality just in one click. It&#8217;s very cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Sarah Norris: </em>Next up is the component section. Got one in here as well. So this is the text control improve theming support. I think this is a little PR for making the border and placeholder colors themable for the text control component specifically. So it means that if you switch the theme, the border and the placeholder colors will also change as well as the other colors related to text control.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>Yeah. And then there&#8217;s a block binding update on the date block. It now allows block binding, so yay. Now you can have the date block. There&#8217;s a date block or post date, for instance. Yeah, you can. Yeah, okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Sarah Norris:</em> Exactly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, you can. Or recording date. Yeah, or something like that. You can connect it to a block binding and make it all follow all the date things in WordPress like location and localized formatting and all that. Block bindings also gets a little bit more wider usage. Opens up for wider usage during 6.9. I have not yet put a whole good research in there, but I&#8217;ve done some testing and it works really, really well also to. To add it to an audio block and all that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Sarah Norris: </em>I can tell you one thing, although it will probably be for Gutenberg changelog 21.6 or 121, but I&#8217;ve been using block bindings. I&#8217;ve been using block bindings for the terms query block as well. And it was unbelievably easy to implement. Just like so much kudos to the people who&#8217;ve been working on block bindings. So I&#8217;ve used it to expose term data so we can absorb that in the new blocks for the terms. And it&#8217;s just. I don&#8217;t know, I&#8217;m just blown away by it really. It just makes so much sense. Makes everything so much more flexible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>Yeah, I use the block bindings too. I registered a separate source for the block bindings for my podcast archive page. Yeah. Because I wanted recording date and stuff, the podcast description and the logo as well as for every episode recording date and the download link just in there in the query loop. And it really worked. Yeah. The audio blog. I&#8217;m still debugging it because of course it&#8217;s all my fault. But it really works well and I&#8217;m so happy that I don&#8217;t have to write new blocks. And I can use a plugin that creates all those fields and has their own template, but the templates are not for block themes. So I can create my own template and add all those blocks bindings and put it into a plugin. So it&#8217;s really cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Sarah Norris: </em>Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> So many more options opening up with block bindings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Sarah Norris: </em>Yeah. What&#8217;s our next section now?</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Documentation</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>So I scroll down to the documentation section of the changelog and I just wanted to point out two things. One is that the Playground CLI is now preferred over the WP now when you use it on any of your projects for playground to have a local development. So it&#8217;s really cool if you&#8217;re developing a plugin, but not in the realm of a website, just on a separate folder. And then you can do playground CLI and then it opens up a WordPress instance right from that and knows it&#8217;s coming from a plugin. So it puts all the stuff from right in there into the playground. It installs it and activates it. And really fast development. Now that was previous was WP now and now it&#8217;s the Playground CLI and it&#8217;s documented. And the second one was the document guidelines on how to get new social icons into Core and have the link to the developer blog article by Justin Tadlock on how to do it yourself. What else? I think that I have the feeling we are now at the end of Gutenberg 21.4.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Sarah Norris: </em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, success.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>And we are coming to Gutenberg 21.5. Do you want to start again?</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Gutenberg 21.5</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Sarah Norris: </em>Yes, I can do. Yeah. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Enhancements</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Starting at enhancements again. So first up is Data Form. Panel layout can open as dropdown or modal. So I think this is adding the. The modal panel type to the data form. And yeah, it basically means that a panel can be opened as a modal, making the data form more flexible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yes, indeed. Yeah. And then the data views also get an additional enhancement as the option is now added to allow Infinite Scroll. On Data Views, you can decide between pagination or infinite scroll like we have in the media library. There&#8217;s an Infinite Scroll Infinite scroll kind of way. So yeah, it kind of opens up a lot more possibilities for Core or plugin developers to use that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Sarah Norris: </em>Next up is the block library section. First up is the query title, adding a post type label variation. So this adds a post type label to the query title block, which displays the singular name of the query post type.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>Yeah. So you know, when you look at it, oh, this is a recipe or this is a post or this is a page. When it kind of comes into the query loop, that&#8217;s definitely helpful, kind of prevents confusion. Definitely, yeah. And then of course we come to your accordion block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Sarah Norris:</em> Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>Is it still experimental or has it been removed? Experimental.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Sarah Norris: </em>It&#8217;s still experimental at the moment. So it&#8217;s only just been merged. Yeah. So we&#8217;re still testing. So the best thing about blocks being experimental is that we can make breaking changes, essentially. So I think it will be experimental until hopefully not the last minute. But, you know, the last minute being the last few weeks, probably before 6.9. But I think I&#8217;m feeling really confident about the block in general. So hopefully just after a few rounds of testing, maybe some tweaks being made. There&#8217;s already been a bunch of. A bunch of PRs opened for some small tweaks as well, which is really nice to see. So, yeah, hopefully it&#8217;ll be. It&#8217;ll be stabilized by 6.9. That&#8217;d be great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>Yeah. Yeah, I hope, I hope so very much though. Yeah. So the accordion block is. It&#8217;s implementing the HTML standard kind of way and then how it kind of works with blocks and you have a whole panel and then you have additional accordion. You have an accordions. It&#8217;s not a accordions block, but it&#8217;s a whole accordion. And then the accordion items, and then you have inner blocks that can house any content in the accordion item panels, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Sarah Norris: </em>Yeah, that&#8217;s right. I think that&#8217;s where I got stuck as well, because I was like, this is multiple accordions. No, it&#8217;s one accordion and then the accordion is made up of multiple sections. Yeah. And then we have to have accordion content and then the accordion header and accordion panel. And within the panel you can add. I think it&#8217;s. I think it&#8217;s all blocks. I should know, shouldn&#8217;t I? But yeah, you can add any, any content within that panel. It just makes it a little bit more flexible than the details block. But I know that the accordion and the details block are very, very similar also at the moment. I think the details block will be surfaced if you search for accordion as well in the block editor. My plan, in my head at the moment, I probably need to write this down somewhere, is that once the accordion block, the new block is stabilized, then we could remove that accordion keyword from the details block. So both of those are two very obvious distinct blocks. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hopefully reduce some confusion. I think the main issue is with the details uses a summary element and I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s semantically correct to add headings, but maybe a bunch of other stuff as well. Basically you can only really technically add text content, which doesn&#8217;t make it very flexible. And then the accordion block will have, at the moment only has an option for one type of icon. But the idea is that we&#8217;re going to add a lot more customization to the icon and making the header content itself more flexible. So yeah, hopefully this accordion block is much more flexible and just it&#8217;s kind of like an advanced block compared to the details. And I think, I think they can both exist fine. They&#8217;re both, they&#8217;re both HTML paradigms. They can both exist as blocks as well. And you know, more blocks. We need more blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>More blocks, yes, definitely. Yeah, yeah. There were also some you you weren&#8217;t able in the details block, you were also not able to. To style the summary separately from the details. So if you put a border around you, it almost was on the same on the whole thing and not on the single. On the details. Yeah, or if you want to have a text styling on the summary, it also would bleed through the details. So yeah, but that&#8217;s wanted I think the details and summary that comes also from Markdown which so you could use it on GitHub and all that and there it really can have additional styling. So the accordion block is definitely for much richer styling and designs available. So are you thinking about handling transforms from details to accordions?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Sarah Norris: </em>I haven&#8217;t thought of that yet, but that makes perfect sense because I imagine. Well, this is only a guess, but I imagine some people have. Users have been using the details block for probably what they would have wanted to use an accordion block for like if they wanted additional styling or for like more advanced FAQ sections and stuff like that. So yes, I imagine that will be a want transforming from a details block to the accordion. So yeah, I&#8217;ll add it to the list.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>Write it down. All right, the next one is again it&#8217;s on the component section and there are a few in there. But I just wanted to point out the forms component that it also now supports an async validation. It means that you can also do server side validation and supports that with a. It&#8217;s a breaking change for this. It&#8217;s a private component so we shouldn&#8217;t even talk about that. Okay, so I didn&#8217;t see that but it&#8217;s. Yeah, it has an async story. So you can have an async validation. Yes, maybe sooner or later we get the public, but yeah, we&#8217;ll see.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Sarah Norris: </em>For themes, there is additional support for providing the border radius presets. So yeah, if you&#8217;re familiar with other presets that you can have in theme JSON for styling, this is one for Border Radius allows you to set border radius presets and then they&#8217;re available in the different controls and it also uses the spacing sizes is like a modal for the way the presets use as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>Yeah, if you are a themer, you definitely want to control the border radius and have users use just the certain numbers for it. Yeah, so if you use a smaller one then it&#8217;s always 15, and it&#8217;s not one is 12 and the other one is 17 or something like that. And then if you want a bigger radius for 25 or something like you don&#8217;t want to kind of that users put in all above 20, so to speak. So you have. You have a more consistent design on your site. And even if you kind of let the users use Border Radius for certain things for designing the next one is. Well, I think. Well, just want to say that the presets for Border Radius is definitely a big thing for theme developers. Yeah, I really get that. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next one is actually a really big thing for anybody who uses WordPress because the command palette comes to the admin dashboard. So you can actually be anywhere in your WordPress admin and then say open Site editor or add page or open style book or something like that. So you don&#8217;t have to find the menu. Click 15 times through the menu to find that particular piece there. Or say add CSS. I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s a command yet, but it definitely should be. So it&#8217;s a much easier way. And a lot of people might actually appreciate that they can do shortcuts pretty much to get to wherever they need to do. For the power users, it&#8217;s definitely an improvement. And I also can see there is. In the roadmap, there was also. That&#8217;s actually part of the roadmap that the command palette is available for the admin dashboard. But it&#8217;s also a foundational piece to get also AI using some of the commands and also to add. To have plugin use add commands to it that are not connected to the site editor. So plugin developers actually can streamline their processes as well for their users. Yeah, it&#8217;s nice. Yeah, it&#8217;s cool. Yeah. And I think now we have. Yeah, there&#8217;s a media for you. Do you want to go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Sarah Norris: </em>I can do for the block library, the median text block. So this is retain use featured image hook value during transformations. So I think this is a bug fix that fixes the media and text transformations to and from a cover block. Basically ensures that the use featured image value is retained during the transformation, which is very important. Don&#8217;t want to be resetting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: It&#8217;s very important. And kind of adds. Removes an additional step people have to think about. So I already did this. Why do I have to do it again?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Sarah Norris: </em>Yeah, exactly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>After they migrated. We are at the end of Gutenberg 21.5. Yes, we did it, Sarah. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What’s in Active Development or Discussed</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Now we have one section left in our podcast that&#8217;s the what&#8217;s in active development or discussed. And as I said in the intro we need more blocks. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">More Blocks</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Matias Ventura, lead architect of Gutenberg and the whole revamping of the admin design, he posted an issue called New Blocks Editions for the Block Library. And there&#8217;s a lot of discussions that we would need there if we need them or not need them. But he comes from a point where he says, okay, for theme to have a good create a good experience for their users, it would be helpful to have these kinds of blocks or some, some of them or all of them in there. So there is no doubt that when a theme styles a block or uses it in patterns or in template parts or something like that, that it&#8217;s not going to be there. And that&#8217;s the experience now that if users use some other block, a theme that assumes there are blocks in there, they get a very confusing message there that so and so block wasn&#8217;t installed if they want to install it or something like that. And I think that&#8217;s for any new user of the WordPress could work inside editor are not very helpful. And so there are some suggested blocks there. Amongst them, the icons block, the playlist block, the slider, slider or carousel block, a stretchy text block, tabs block, accordion block. We have that Mega menus, math ML block, marquee block, table of content, time to read breadcrumbs and dialogue block. That&#8217;s kind of the list. I think it can go on and on and on, but I think it&#8217;s a good list there. I felt I&#8217;m a little bit okay, the marquee block. Didn&#8217;t we outphase that in the, in the 90s already? But I think it comes in handy when you have a news sticker across the top or something like that. MathML I think it&#8217;s a good block for educational sites, especially in math education. So I don&#8217;t know if that needs to be in the core or it can still be a plugin. Actually, Adam Silverstein created a plugin with the MathML block or the breadcrumbs block. Definitely important because that&#8217;s so important that we can help people find their way back. So a lot of people chime in. Aaron Jorban, Mike McAllister, Jeff Paul, Rich Tabor, Joe Dalston, Hendrik Larsen, Jeff Chandler yeah, a lot of people kind of join me in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Sarah Norris: </em>Yeah, it&#8217;s great to see.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> What do you think?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Sarah Norris:</em> It&#8217;s great to see so much interaction and conversation about new blocks. I think generally most people think that we should have more blocks, but I think the contention comes down to per block and which one should be added. And I think that&#8217;s fine. I think that it&#8217;s fine to have a discussion per block about that. But at the moment I think the lack of blocks just limits the flexibility and design opportunities in the editor. So that&#8217;s where maybe the decision process is a little bit easier for things like the accordion block, because it&#8217;s such an obvious design choice and option to have. Similar to the tabs block, probably the carousel block icons. But then there&#8217;s others like you mentioned about MathML maybe would have less users, but that doesn&#8217;t mean it shouldn&#8217;t be in core. It&#8217;s probably just a longer conversation or maybe it doesn&#8217;t make it into core. I&#8217;m not sure how I feel about the marquee block because I think it&#8217;d be really fun to have a marquee block. But I also understand that maybe, you know, not. Not everyone would want to use it. So maybe it doesn&#8217;t warrant going in. But then it&#8217;s fun, isn&#8217;t it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>So, yeah, there&#8217;s fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Sarah Norris: </em>I don&#8217;t know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>I have also seen that there&#8217;s a developers and user usability. People don&#8217;t like sliders and carousels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Sarah Norris: </em>Right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>But users or site owners like them very much. Yeah, exactly. So I talked with a few and at WordCamp US I talked with a few agency owners, said, yeah, that&#8217;s one of the blocks that we built ourselves because we need it on every single project that we are doing. Yeah. I can&#8217;t keep them kind of say, okay, there are alternatives when they want it. You know, our customers want them and so we build them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Sarah Norris: </em>Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> And they&#8217;re pretty good to. They&#8217;re pretty navigational things, so interactive things. So if the site has no activity at all, this is actually getting you back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Sarah Norris:</em> Yeah, exactly. And so many of these blocks listed in this issue that Matias opened, so many of them already have so much work. They already have a PR or. And they&#8217;ve probably just stalled the same question of how do we do this? Why should we do this? Do we need this block? So I think it&#8217;s just a case of going through each block and having that conversation. Because the accordion block, I only picked it up and finished it. Jeff had done. Already done so much good work on that and that&#8217;s why it was able to be landed so quickly and yeah. In a similar position with many of the others. So, yeah, I&#8217;m looking forward to that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>Yeah. I think the table of contents has received quite a few iterations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Sarah Norris:</em> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> And just a few pieces missing that would make it a little bit more a little easier to handle, but we all kind of found our ways around it. But for that, we always have to install Gutenbergs to have the blocks there. And not everyone wants to use Gutenberg in production. Yeah, still. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right. Okay. So we are coming to the end of our Gutenberg Changelog podcast. As always, the show notes will be published on GutenbergTimes.com podcast and if you have questions, suggestions, or news that you want us to include, send them to <a href=\"http://changelogutenbergtimes.com\">changelogutenbergtimes.com</a> that&#8217;s <a href=\"http://changelogutenburgtimes.com\">changelogutenburgtimes.com</a> Thank you so much, Sarah, for being here, and thank you to all the listeners for listening.

Now theme builders have way fewer tools compared to before—you can&#8217;t just include breadcrumbs, accordions, or icons without finding specific blocks for them. When users don&#8217;t have the right blocks installed, they get ugly error messages.

It’s perfect for teams that live and breathe WordPress and want a simpler front-end setup. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The article takes a look at the WordPress Interactivity API by testing it out in real-life client projects.

Plus, it gives some tips on how to implement it and some advice on when to pick this API over the others.

The Abilities API creates a common language for all WordPress components to define their functionalities, making it easier for both humans and machines to understand. By using this shared language, plugins, and themes can help AI solutions find, interpret, and use capabilities across the WordPress ecosystem. You can learn more about this new feature on the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/ai/2025/07/17/abilities-api/\">Make blog of the AI Team</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-s-new-for-wordpress-playground\">What&#8217;s new for WordPress Playground</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In this episode on the OpenChannels <a href=\"https://openchannels.fm/learn-how-wordpress-playground-revolutionizes-local-development-testing-and-learning/\">Learn How WordPress Playground Revolutionizes Local Development Testing and Learning</a> <strong>Abha Thakor</strong> and <strong>Fellyph Cintra</strong> discuss WordPress Playground, its features, accessibility, and impact on developers and users.

At the business and commerce plan level the plugin library is available for both free and paid plugins, which is great, and for more advanced users and developers they offer features like <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/hosting/#extensibility\">staging servers, SSH access, WP-CLI, github deployments</a>, and a <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.com/studio/\">local development environment</a>.

My name is Nathan Wrigley.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jukebox is a podcast which is dedicated to all things WordPress, the people, the events, the plugins, the blocks, the themes, and in this case, how WordPress is shaping the future of education for students worldwide.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to subscribe to the podcast, you can do that by searching for WP Tavern in your podcast player of choice, or by going to wptavern.com/feed/podcast, and you can copy that URL into most podcast players.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a topic that you&#8217;d like us to feature on the podcast, I&#8217;m keen to hear from you and hopefully get you, or your idea, featured on the show. Head to wptavern.com/contact/jukebox, and use the form there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So on the podcast today, we have Destiny Kanno, Isotta Peira, and Anand Upadhyay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Destiny is the Head of Community Education at Automattic. Isotta is the leader of the WordPress Credits Initiative for students, and Anand is the founder of WordPress Campus Connect.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This episode is all about how WordPress is not only powering websites, but also empowering the next generation of learners and creators. You&#8217;ll hear about the growing movement of education focused WordPress events happening worldwide, from hands-on workshops on university campuses in India, to student clubs designed to keep the momentum going after introductory events.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anand shares how WP Campus Connect is bringing WordPress directly to students, reducing barriers to entry, and helping bridge the gap between academic learning and real world tech skills. We also explore the challenges of organizing these events, from convincing institutions of the value of open source, to fostering genuine community involvement among both students and educators.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Isotta then introduces us to the WordPress Credits Program, an initiative that lets students turn their contributions to the WordPress ecosystem into recognized academic credits at universities like, Pisa in Italy. It&#8217;s a win-win. Students gain practical resume worthy experience, while educational institutions get a transferable, skills focused, program that prepares learners for the jobs of the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you&#8217;re an educator, a WordPress enthusiast, or just someone who cares about open source and community, this episode is packed with actionable insights. The guests share how flexible and resilient these education initiatives are, how you can get involved, and why engaging the next generation is not just important, but essential for the continued growth and sustainability of the WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a truly inspiring episode, and is at the intersection of so many areas of profound importance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re curious about how to bring WordPress into your local school, university, or community, or if you just want to hear how WordPress is making a difference far beyond the web, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in finding out more, you can find all of the links in the show notes by heading to wptavern.com/podcast, where you&#8217;ll find all the other episodes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so without further delay, I bring you Destiny Kanno, Isotta Peira and Anand Upadhyay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am joined on the podcast by Destiny Kanno, by Isotta Peira, and also by Anand Upadhyay. Welcome all three of you. Thanks for joining me today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now just before we begin this podcast, we&#8217;re going to be talking about education, the education landscape, and how WordPress combines with that. I hope during the course of this conversation, you will get an impression that this is something which is very dear to my heart. We don&#8217;t need to go into that, but this is about the most profoundly purposeful use of a CMS that I can actually imagine. I mean, I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s other scenarios for other people, but for me, this is the perfect sweet spot. Education, WordPress, open source software. It doesn&#8217;t basically get better than that for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So with that out of the way, I think it would be good to go round the houses one at a time and just give a little short biography of who you are, where you work, what your history is with WordPress, something like that. You can make it as long or as short as you like, but if we keep it under a minute, maybe something like that, that would be good. So let&#8217;s go to Destiny first.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:46] <strong>Destiny Kanno:</strong> Yes. Hi there, I&#8217;m Destiny. I&#8217;m currently head of community education at Automattic. I&#8217;m a sponsored contributor in the .org space. And yes, before working on the exciting new initiatives we&#8217;re going to chat through today, I was working alongside the training team, two years as a training team rep, helping build out content, like online workshops and courses and learning pathways. And I was part of the group of folks that brought that new relaunch live last year. So yeah, exciting stuff, and that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m up to right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:23] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay, that&#8217;s great. Thank you so much. We have some context there, that&#8217;s lovely. And okay, let&#8217;s go to Isotta. Do you want to give us your bio next?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:30] <strong>Isotta Peira:</strong> Sure. Thanks a lot Nathan for inviting us and, yeah. I&#8217;m Isotta, I&#8217;ve been around the community since, WordPress community since 2022 when I joined Automattic, and I&#8217;ve been a sponsored contributor since then. For the past year, three years, four years, I&#8217;ve been contributing full time to the community team. And recently this year I switched on to the educational initiative, and I&#8217;m currently leading the WordPress Credits program for students.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:01] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay, thank you very much. And finally, Anand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:04] <strong>Anand Upadhyay:</strong> Hi, my name is Anand, and I am running a WordPress plugin development company WPVibes. I am a user of WordPress from the last 15 years, since 2010 I&#8217;m using WordPress for various purposes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have been contributing to WordPress through much multiple channels like Core, docs, polyglots, jumping from one team to another. And from the last year, I have found like my new passion. Just like you, I am also passionate about education and teaching. So from the last year, I found this idea of WordPress Campus Connect, and currently I&#8217;m very much involved in trying to bring it to the broader community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:39] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Thank you so much. So I think we&#8217;ve established that the panelists today, there&#8217;s a lot of really meaningful contributions in all of your past, especially around WordPress and education. So let&#8217;s dig into that a little bit. As I said at the top of this show, I can&#8217;t see a more meaningful use of WordPress, frankly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, I don&#8217;t know what it&#8217;s like in the places where you live, but in the UK where I live, education is one of those things where we like to talk about it being a priority, but the finances kind of don&#8217;t really match up to that aspiration. And so things like ICT, websites, coding, all of that, it&#8217;s a nice thing to have, but I think often it gets left in the background a little bit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And because of that, things like open source platforms, I feel there&#8217;s a really great use of that, not only from the educator&#8217;s point of view, you know, people that can use those platforms to help with their class education, maybe set up a community website, maybe set up a school website or something like that. But also from the point of view of learners, people who wish to get a leg up in life, and figure that maybe learning technology and learning how to build on the web is a credible place for them to start.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So let&#8217;s just go through, where is WordPress at the moment in the educational landscape? I know that&#8217;s incredibly broad because we haven&#8217;t sort of pinned it down to any of the projects. Where are we at? What are the initiatives that are going on at the moment? So, again, anybody that wants to jump in, if we do a bit of crosstalking, so be it. But anybody that wants to jump in, just go for it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:13] <strong>Destiny Kanno:</strong> I&#8217;ll start from like what I&#8217;ve observed a little bit. I&#8217;m pretty new to the Community Team itself and this event space, but I have seen that there have been a few education related events happening throughout the years, regardless of WordPress Campus Connect.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like in Africa, they recently had their, I think it&#8217;s annual event, I believe in Uganda. And that has been going on for a while. It just hasn&#8217;t been under like the name WordPress Campus Connect.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then I believe as well, and correct me if I&#8217;m wrong, there was, with Sebastian in Poland, this like WordPress Academy, like they&#8217;re also doing like education type events and initiatives. But when it comes to now this WordPress Campus Connect, it&#8217;s an official event series, like do_action. It has like more intention around that. And I think because when you go in and you, you know, apply to organise, and now there&#8217;s this way to do it through WordPress Campus Connect, it&#8217;s just going to bring those initiatives that are already happening into like a more streamlined funnel of people seeing that it&#8217;s happening, I think, in a more, how do I say it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:21] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Cohesive would be the word.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:22] <strong>Destiny Kanno:</strong> Yeah, cohesive way. Thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:24] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, so I guess what you&#8217;re saying there is that there&#8217;s a lot of people out there in the WordPress community, many of whom might be educators or, you know, working in a school or what have you, and that they&#8217;ve rolled their own thing like we all have with WordPress. And that&#8217;s great. That&#8217;s one of the benefits of having open source software. You download it, roll your own, what have you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it&#8217;s also, it&#8217;s nice, it&#8217;s meaningful, it&#8217;s impactful if everybody can see, oh, there&#8217;s a bigger, kind of more organised piece somewhere. And it may not fit exactly what I&#8217;m doing, but at least I can see that it can be deployed this way. Maybe I can talk to those people, get some intuitions and ideas from those people and what have you, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:01] <strong>Isotta Peira:</strong> I wanted to jump in and connect with what Destiny was saying because this is exactly what happened from the community perspective. So talking about events, a few years ago we were seeing the Training Team doing a lot of great progress around education and the Community Team around events. But we weren&#8217;t that connected between contribution teams. And we&#8217;ve also, as like project wise, we were seeing also the need to bring a different type of audience to the WordPress events.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we weren&#8217;t exploring at all the education field. With all the students around the world, we weren&#8217;t like taking care of them in our programs. So from the Community Team, they kind of encourage organisers all over the world to come up with new diverse format for events. And in 2023 it was launched this, it was called at the time next generation of WordPress events.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And one of the formats that stood out was exactly the Campus Connect brought up by Anand and the community. And other events like the Website challenge, and the others that&#8217;s been mentioned. And as he was saying, then we have had the time now to come back, connect the pieces between different contribution teams, and be able to offer something recognisable, standardised, something not as overwhelming as sometimes open source programs are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so we hope not just to reach a wider audience of students, but also to empower more teachers, more trainings, and anybody else in the community into bringing WordPress in any different type of education at different levels. With the support of course of the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:47] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> We will get into the bits that WP Campus Connect do in a moment, but just coming back to something that you said there, it feels to me, if I browse around in the WordPress landscape, and trust me, I browse around in the WordPress landscape rather a lot. It always feels to me as if, how to describe this, initiatives where companies sell WordPress on, they build things and there&#8217;s a fee involved. You know, so you&#8217;re a web agency or what have you, you build the thing and you sell it on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That seems to dominate the conversation. And the more philanthropic side of things, the education piece, the bit where you&#8217;re just, you&#8217;re doing the work because it&#8217;s meaningful, and perhaps you are not getting remunerated for it. That bit somehow gets, well, it gets ignored. It somehow is the silent relation of the for-profit things. You know, you hang out in Facebook groups and you hang out on Twitter, X, whatever, online, it&#8217;s always the for-profit bit, which seems to be making the noise, you know, the plugins, the themes, and rah, rah, rah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And this kind of stuff seems to get left. And I don&#8217;t know why that is, but it&#8217;s, hopefully this podcast is addressing some of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyway, sorry Anand, I think it&#8217;s your turn to have a little bit of a chat with us. Tell us about, yeah, the same question really, your experience in the education space and where you think WordPress is at at the moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:02] <strong>Anand Upadhyay:</strong> Yeah, so just as you explained about the state of education in the UK, so the same is in our region, India as well. So students in the academic life are slightly disconnected with the, what is happening in the industry? So there is like a gap between the academics and the industry. So through these kind of events, we are empowering the students to come closer to what really happening in there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we are also helping them to make aware about the various carrier opportunities that WordPress ecosystem can bring to them. It&#8217;s not like about just one thing, it&#8217;s also about if someone is interested in programming, someone is interested in designing, SEO, content. So there is something for everyone, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So with this program, we are trying to connect the students with the various career opportunities, and also trying to bring some fresh energy to the WordPress ecosystem. They can become the contributors, they can bring their own fresh perspective. Because I have read somewhere the WordPress community in many areas is aging. We need that new fresh energy. So this kind of program can also address that problem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s always good to have more people getting involved in the contribution, like sort of just started with the WP Credit, which is bringing actually students to the contribution. And the Campus program is trying to introduce them to the WordPress. So all these kind of programmers combined with working towards getting more and more people getting involved in the WordPress ecosystem, and trying to make the project more sustainable in the long run.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:28] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It&#8217;s kind of interesting, I attend quite a lot of WordPress events, and particularly the flagship events so, you know, the WordCamp Asia&#8217;s and Europe&#8217;s and US and what have you. And, I think you&#8217;re right about the demographic. The demographic definitely skews older. It&#8217;s hard to see anything above, I would imagine 10% of the crowd that would be under the age of 20. I have no data to back any of that up. I&#8217;m kind of putting my finger in the air a little bit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it feels like that. It feels like the demographic is, I don&#8217;t know, 30, 35, 40 and above. And if that were the only reason that you were doing WP Campus Connect, that in itself would be a credible reason, you know? But obviously there&#8217;s a lot more to it than that. But just that alone would be significant and important.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think also, in a world dominated by proprietary platforms where everything is siloed, you don&#8217;t own your own data, the experience is exciting because there&#8217;s some kind of algorithm trying to hook into your brainstem, then we need to get these young people. And because we don&#8217;t have the marketing budgets of a Facebook or a TikTok or what have you, then we have to do it in different ways. And attaching an event to a campus, to a university, to an educational institution is a great way I think of doing this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So firstly, bravo, for getting this thing off the ground. Perhaps this one is for Anand again. I don&#8217;t know if he wants to take this question, but can you just describe what WP Campus Connect is? What&#8217;s involved in that? What&#8217;s the age group? Where are you doing it predominantly? How long has it been going? As much or as little as you like. And depending on what you give back to us, we can take it from there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:09] <strong>Anand Upadhyay:</strong> Yeah, so WordPress Campus Connect, there is no like fixed criteria on to whom you are going to deliver this. So the only thing is we are going to the students, we are going to their campus. We are not creating a kind of WordCamp kind of thing, or centralised workshop where everybody is coming to our venue and we are delivering them the knowledge, but it&#8217;s about going to their campus. And because this will reduce the friction, like if we are going to organise an event, centralised event, we are inviting everyone to join, then there will be a friction. A lot of people might not going to join. Maybe there were some valid reasons as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So with Campus Connect, we are going to their campus and delivering the WordPress knowledge to them. And so far we have done this in the universities, postgraduate colleges, undergraduate students. And we are helping them to understand the WordPress, how WordPress can be a career choice for them, and how WordPress can be useful for whatever their interest is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because as I already said, that there is students, if we are going to a college or university, that every student might have different kind of interests. Maybe they are enrolled in the same course, but still they have, might have some different kind of interests.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we are trying to explain them that they are with various career opportunities available so you can jump in. And we are doing it through the hands-on workshops. It&#8217;s not like that we are just doing a kind of seminar or lecture kind of thing. We are doing it in form of a kind of a hands-on workshop, like five to six hour workshop where we will help them to build their first website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it&#8217;s not about like we want to make them expert in six hours. It&#8217;s not possible. So what we want to do is, we want to give them a feeling of accomplishment. This is something that is something interesting and this is something that we can use and build something.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So this way, if they get some, after six hour workshop or five hours workshop, if they&#8217;re coming out with kind of feeling of accomplishment that this is interesting, we should explore it further, we should explore it more. So that&#8217;s our win.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:05] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Can I ask, in the part of the world where you are, is there a real hunger for this? Is there a real appetite for this? Because with the best will in the world, I think there might be a geographical divide in terms of interest and hunger for things like WordPress. And again, there&#8217;s no heuristics behind this, this is me supposing from what I&#8217;ve heard and conversations that I have had.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It feels like in your part of the world, and you only have to look at plugin contributions, contributions to Core, events that are taking place in your neck of the woods. It seems like there&#8217;s a real appetite for it, that there may not be quite in the part of the world where I am from. So first of all, can we speak to that? Is that the case? Is it like, you know, you put this stuff on and people show up? You build it and they come?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:56] <strong>Anand Upadhyay:</strong> Yeah, so there is a quite hunger. India is like a kind of a very large country and if you count the number of WordCamps that happening in India every year, it&#8217;s quite big. Right now, these are like two, three months where we don&#8217;t have any WordCamps because it&#8217;s mostly the rainy season in everywhere. Otherwise every month you will have one or two WordCamps. And the communities that are organising WordCamps struggle to find a date that is not conflicting with another WordCamp in the same country. So that&#8217;s how the things happen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you talk about the beginning of this year, first three weekends have WordCamps in India, and all were very successful. So there is a kind of WordPress community is very engaging in India, and so the way everywhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And also if you talk about the hunger in the students, so it can vary about what they are learning, what their background is, where they&#8217;re located. But, yeah, students from what we have interacted, because we interacted with the students who doesn&#8217;t have any knowledge. We got a very good response. We saw them talking about like, oh, this is great. We can do something amazing with this. We have a lot of ideas already. This is something that we can use to implement those ideas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there is surely a hunger, but we just need to give them a path like, this is the path, and you can follow this. And we need to ensure them, there&#8217;s big opportunities, big market opportunities are also waiting for them if they excellent with some skills in this segment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:20] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, I think it&#8217;s true to say that more or less every young person, let&#8217;s go, child or young adult or what have you, has some sort of insatiable appetite to learn. But given the education that they&#8217;re presented with, given the opportunities that are put in front of them, their experience of life later on will be very different. And so if WordPress never comes on the menu for them, if nobody ever suggests, well, have a look at this thing, then they&#8217;ll never know about this thing. This whole wonderful world of online publishing and all of the myriad things that you can do around the WordPress ecosystem. And so WP Campus Connect, I guess is facilitating that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, curiously though, you said that you go to where the educational institution is. How does that work? How do you connect, so again, this doesn&#8217;t have to go to Anand, this can go to anybody. How do you connect the educator, let&#8217;s say, or the institution that wishes to put something on because, you know, their students might like it. How do you connect the educational institution with the people who then go in and provide this WordPress workshop and training? How does that work? How does that get paid for? Is it all voluntary? There&#8217;s a lot in there to unpack, but I hope you get the thrust of my question. How do all those jigsaw pieces fit together?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:37] <strong>Anand Upadhyay:</strong> The first thing is it&#8217;s all voluntary. So just like in a WordCamp, we have an organising team, a team of organisers and speakers. Nobody&#8217;s getting paid for this. We are also doing it voluntary. We have a team of organisers, not specifically to me, every WordCamp has a team of organisers, have a team of volunteers, workshop facilitators who are organising the workshops. So it&#8217;s all voluntary, nobody&#8217;s getting paid.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And also it&#8217;s free for students as well. There is no charge for students from the WordPress Campus team. So it&#8217;s not like we are putting a kind of a ticket to them. It&#8217;s completely free. Going to your question about getting the institutes convinced for letting us do the workshop in their campus, so it&#8217;s kind of a tricky thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first time we reached out to the institute, so it was very tricky. I get to the college with a pitch deck. So I pitched the complete idea, complete presentation to show them what is WordPress, what are the kind of community thing? Because every institute has this question like, why you are doing this? What are your benefit?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And It&#8217;s the same thing that you said, we have to pass that bureaucracy before getting to the better benefit of the student. We have to go to the bureaucracy. And it&#8217;s a genuine question in their mind as well, because, not a lot of such communities exist that are doing these kind of free things voluntarily. For the students. So the first question we were asked is, why are you doing this? What are your benefits? And don&#8217;t expect anything from us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:58] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It rings so bizarre in the world in which we live. Everything about that screams, hang on. Wait, where&#8217;s the catch? Where&#8217;s the sales pitch? What&#8217;s going to happen after the fact?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:10] <strong>Anand Upadhyay:</strong> We have to work on with this way and we have to explain like complete things. We showed them that these are the big events that in the WordCamp ecosystem happens, and we are trying to create a unique initiative for students and we&#8217;ll be delivering everything free to them. And we were not going to charge, we just need you to provide the students and the required infrastructure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the pitch is really tough. In some institutes we got very understanding people who understood what we are saying. Within the next 15 minutes, we got them convinced. In some places we have to discuss a lot of questions. But yeah, it was again, interesting experience as well. We got some general feedback from them as, because last time it was the very first time we were doing this kind of thing. We don&#8217;t have any reference, like we just have an idea like we are going through this thing. So we also brainstorm with them like, what are the expectation of your students? They also gave us some suggestions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So because in every institute you&#8217;ll find different kind of students, you have to plan your workshops, you have to plan your workflow according to the interest of the students. So that&#8217;s how we approached, yeah, to convince the institute is the most tricky part. Because other than that, if you have to do workshop, we have our facilitators who are already working in WordPress. So it&#8217;s not difficult for them to deliver the same knowledge to adults. The only barrier that we have is to convince the college and universities to join and become a partner.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:32] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> And has that journey, that, I guess bridge that you&#8217;ve got to cross, has that now become more straightforward? In that, you&#8217;ve got a history of things that you&#8217;ve done. So it&#8217;s now more a case of, look, here&#8217;s the testimonials. Here&#8217;s the things that have happened. We have credibility, we&#8217;ve done it before. This is not brand new. Has that become an easier journey? In other words, the door is more open than it was the first few times around.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:54] <strong>Anand Upadhyay:</strong> Yeah, so the last year it was very tough. We have to reach up to them, take appointment, go there and spend some time there. And this year in the institute where we have done this last year, I just sent them a message like, we are doing it again, and if you want to be a part, just fill this form and we will discuss further.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It works. So it&#8217;s much easier. And to those who are not a partner last year, but they have seen our post on the social media after the event, and they reached out to us like somehow we missed it, this time connect with us whenever you are doing it again. So once you have done this thing, you have a credibility and you can just showcase them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After that event, we have got a lot of the students joining our meetup. Before that, I&#8217;m running our city meetup from 2017, and we barely get 10 to 12 members in every meetup. Right now we are doing the meetups of 40 to 50 members. And it&#8217;s a kind of amazing thing. And it&#8217;s not only about having a lot of the students only. After seeing the students joining in, after seeing our pictures and the sort of local community going on, some professionals are also jumping in to join the meetups.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because they see that there is something valuable going on. So they&#8217;re also joining. So this is something amazing, because this is a byproduct. You&#8217;ll be able to grow your local community. You&#8217;ll be able to strengthen your local community more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:10] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I have such profound respect for what you are doing. It is almost bringing tears to my eyes. It&#8217;s incredible. Everything that you say there is just so philanthropic. It&#8217;s just philanthropy all the way down. College students probably don&#8217;t have a great deal of money to throw around. They would want to consume education, which will make their life prospects better. They would like that to be as affordable as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you show up, like here&#8217;s a bunch of stuff and it&#8217;s completely free. Okay, that&#8217;s great. And then there&#8217;s this virtuous cycle of, okay, we do it each year. That becomes easier, because the testimonials work, and presumably you can spread out and the ripples will move around where you live. And then hopefully maybe hop through jurisdictions and borders and international, who knows? We can get to that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But then also this knock on effect, which was maybe unexpected, a consequence that was unexpected of the WordPress community, the meetups that you offer, the swelling there and swelling in the, we talked about the demographics earlier, it&#8217;s skewing younger. And if you can attract a percentage of those, and keep them sticking around in the community, they can then take on these roles in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the whole thing kind of propels itself. What it needed was the prime mover, which was you, which is pretty incredible. So I don&#8217;t know if Destiny or Isotta want to add anything. I&#8217;m almost speechless.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:31] <strong>Destiny Kanno:</strong> I did have like a few points I wanted to add to what everyone&#8217;s saying. Reducing barriers has been a huge factor of setting this up. Originally we were using like the previous event organisation form and were like, actually there&#8217;s a lot of stuff in here. It doesn&#8217;t make sense for this use case. So we really paid a lot of attention to just thinking differently for this, and treating it differently. We don&#8217;t have to use the same things as we had before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And Isotta said before, like it&#8217;s standardised in a way, but it&#8217;s flexible too. So even though we have this framework that people can come to, we don&#8217;t say, you can only do the event in this way. You can have a one day event, you could do a half day event, you could have event series over a couple weeks like Anand is doing, and that is totally cool. Like, however you want to run this, we are open to that, and we&#8217;re also here to mentor you and support you in that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then I, a thought came to my mind as Anand was talking, and you Nathan as well about like, you know, what&#8217;s in it for the volunteers? And I&#8217;m like, I think it&#8217;s an opportunity for volunteers just as much as it is the students, because they&#8217;re also getting exposure to these universities. And I don&#8217;t know, maybe someone has an ambition to teach at university someday, or like at least teach about WordPress at a university. So, you know, as you go into these, yes, there&#8217;s a hundred percent the philanthropic aspect, but it&#8217;s also like a learning experience for you as well as a volunteer to be in that space with the students too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then lastly, I wanted to say as well, like going a little bit back about the current climate and how it feels like we are kind of like aging, I&#8217;ve also noticed in my experience it&#8217;s like, we are all also just, this is probably very like, duh, but we&#8217;re all professionals, right? So we&#8217;re not really looking to talk to students most of the time. We&#8217;re looking to sell something or network or like talk to other professionals. So I do think that this is a great way to bring in that new batch of folks that are going to become professionals, hopefully in the WordPress space. But yeah, it&#8217;s just that renewal instead of like just trying to sell or buy from whoever&#8217;s there based off of whatever you&#8217;re currently working on in the WordPress space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:46] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Thank you. Isotta, anything you want to throw in at this point?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:49] <strong>Isotta Peira:</strong> Of course. I want to add one point about the aging discussion that we were having, because also, in my opinion, it is true what you, Nathan, said at the beginning that just only the fact of reaching younger people is a way to make the project more sustainable, long term. But also I would love everyone to think about the other way around, because what is WordPress giving to all these younger generations?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because wins are much, I mean, for how I see it, I see like a winning opportunity everywhere. Because it&#8217;s not just about reducing the age of the people involved in the project. If we reduce the age, but people are not engaged. If they&#8217;re not getting what they need, learning opportunities, networking opportunities, even just opportunities to understand that they have a whole world around them, they didn&#8217;t even know that it existed, which happened to me before I learned about WordPress community and WordPress, this is huge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So this is a real, like all this initiative are core of the service that will be giving to millions of students. For now, we are at thousands of students already, but, this would be available for any students worldwide. And this is a pretty big deal, I believe, for younger generation and their futures.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:12] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I think it&#8217;s, on every level this is just so remarkably interesting, and the growth of it hopefully we&#8217;ll get into the millions. Right now you say you&#8217;re in the thousands. It&#8217;s still remarkable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I want to sort of drill into it a little bit. So it feels like there&#8217;s this sort of double fronted marketplace aspect to it where WP Campus Connect kind of sits in the middle, and so you&#8217;ve got WP Campus Connect in the center, and then on the one side you&#8217;ve got the students and the institutions that those students attend. And then on the other side, you&#8217;ve got the educators who will come into that institution and WP Campus Connect is sort of like the fulcrum, the center, the spokes all lead into WP Campus Connect, and they do all the connecting and what have you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s talk about the educator side. So this is people who already are familiar with WordPress. Are there any constraints on who you would welcome into WP Campus Connect there? Like, is there any level of expertise that you&#8217;ve got to have, or any kind of proof that you&#8217;ve got to go through that you, yourself would be a credible educator? I don&#8217;t know, so that&#8217;s open to anybody. Is there any kind of barrier to entry if you are an existing WordPresser and want to be involved?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:20] <strong>Anand Upadhyay:</strong> Yeah, so far we have not planned any kind of a specific requirements or the limitations or criteria. So far we have picked from the local community members, like we just opened the call for facilitators, and all those who are interested in teaching. And they responded to it and we just picked them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are doing a kind of a series of event to, I think five to six colleges in this time and going every weekend to one college. So we have a pool of four workshop facilitators and we&#8217;ll be rotating them to multiple colleges. So this is how it is working. So there is no kind of barrier kind of thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are just thinking about if they are ready for the community work, because there may be many educators, but there may not be everyone who will be doing it for free because we are not going to pay them anything. So if they have the community feeling, they have the community vibes and they can come forward for this. So that&#8217;s the only criteria we have. You have the WordPress knowledge, you have the love for community. Just come forward and join us for the event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:19] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay, that&#8217;s great. Great to hear. So staying on that side of things then, I remember my forays in education, one of the things that was kind of drummed into me was, failing to plan is planning to fail. And so there was always this aspect of, if you&#8217;re going to stand up in front of a bunch of people, you have to be ready. You can&#8217;t necessarily, I mean you can, right? A workshop environment maybe maps to that pretty well, where you stand up and it&#8217;s led by what the audience, the students in this case, would like to hear.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m wondering if there&#8217;s a curriculum which you have planned or do plan, or if somebody can kind of like drop in and just pick up the pieces of paper if you like and say, okay, here&#8217;s the lesson plan, if you like. WP Campus Connect has put these plans together, and we&#8217;re going to go and show these students how to do this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that is my ignorance. I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s the kind of thing that you do. Do you provide materials for wannabe educators to deliver, or is it very much you create your own curriculum on the fly or however you wish to do that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:16] <strong>Anand Upadhyay:</strong> So we just meet together and just plan, just think about like how we can go on ahead, like what are the things that we to teach? And we just brainstorm it together. It&#8217;s not like we are giving the, because there is not much different between the organiser and workshop facilitators here. So we are all the community members, so we have just divided the roles, but we are all, they&#8217;re working towards the same goal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we just all sit together, brainstorm the ideas, like what should we give to the students? So for example, last year we helped them to build a kind of a business website. So all the educators plan together. So we will follow this workflow, we will follow this approach. And we went to one college, we tried to do the same thing. We came back and then we again said what went wrong? What was difficult for the students to follow? How we can overcome them in the next college? We repeat, we improvise and deliver the same thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This year we, again, we are planning, so we again sit together. And then we thought about, last year we helped them to create a kind of a simple business website, but we found that students were not connected with that. They built the same thing, but they didn&#8217;t utilise it later because it was not connected to them. So this year we are planning to help them to build their personal portfolio website, a kind of a resume, where they can showcase their projects, they can showcase their resume, they can showcase their work or learning what they have done. So we are planning that kind of website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So again, our workshop facilitators are working together, all those educators, and working together to create a kind of a reference website. And then we will guide them to recreate this, the same thing, adding their own touch because this will be more personalised thing. They will get attached to this, and maybe we can have some of the students to put their websites live. So it&#8217;ll be, again, a good chance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we are also getting some support from the hosting companies who are offering some pre-hosting accounts so we can do kind of a competition kind of thing, or someone who has done incredible work during the workshops and post workshop, we can provide them those free hostings and they can get the chance to put their website live.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:21] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay, so it&#8217;s a real kind of project based education then. So you walk into the room, you interact with the educators, you ask questions, I&#8217;m struggling with this thing, I can&#8217;t make this work, and they come and step in. So you described it as a workshop and maybe the audience, I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;re familiar with that kind of setup, but education often felt like to me, person at the front with some kind of display, whiteboard, blackboard, whatever. They talk, I listen, I fall asleep.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But this is not that. This is, okay, we have a project, we&#8217;re going to design a business website, a personal portfolio, resume kind of website. And the idea is that you interact with that and by the time you&#8217;ve left, you&#8217;ve got some useful knowledge. You&#8217;ve done a thing, not just listen to somebody talking about possibly doing a thing hands on. Okay, that&#8217;s brilliant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is there any kind of age restriction? Because obviously if I was to bring along a 3-year-old to this, we would question the utility of that. You kept talking about colleges and I think you mentioned universities a couple of times. So it feels to me as if we&#8217;re 18 or something is kind of where this goes, yeah?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:28] <strong>Anand Upadhyay:</strong> Yeah, most of the students we interacted with are around mostly 17 plus we can say, 17 or 18 plus. So that&#8217;s the age group. And this year we have got a student, we have got a request from one of the high school as well. So they want to, their approach was very nice. They want to give the students kind of exposure to what they are going to face after completing their high school. So they&#8217;re running kind of a program so they&#8217;re also interested in if we can just go to their school and give their students some kind of a short introduction about any skill that is relevant for them. So we&#8217;re also getting that kind of request as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:04] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, and that&#8217;s such an interesting age as well, because you haven&#8217;t yet kind of formulated your path. And I think maybe by the time you get to 16, 17, 18, you&#8217;re more funneled. You&#8217;ve made decisions which have led you in a certain direction. You know, I&#8217;m going to be a, I&#8217;m into agriculture, I want to do whatever it may be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But if the high school level, everything&#8217;s wide open still, isn&#8217;t it? And if you can get them and expose somebody that&#8217;s never been on a computer even, and, oh look, I put something and people nowhere in me can suddenly see it, that may open up a completely new pathway.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But what you&#8217;ve got going at the moment, what do these students get in return? Is there like a quid pro quo? Is there some, sort of leading question here really. Is there some credit that you might get on the other end of this? Do students get to walk away with, apart from obviously the knowledge, which is now in their head for life, do they get to walk away with some kind of accreditation to say, I did this, here&#8217;s my certificate, or whatever it may be?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:59] <strong>Anand Upadhyay:</strong> Yeah. So we are again providing them certificates for the completion of attending the workshop. And, yes, obviously they are getting some amazing knowledge, amazing exposure to the community. Yeah, but as a proof of thing that they have done something, we are providing them certificates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:14] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay. And obviously, you know, if they then continue that participation in the meetups and what have you, you get the bit which is way more important than the certificate, which is the actual exposure to the people out there in the real world who can give you that leg up or point you in the right direction for the person that you need to help you on that first career step.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;m just going to the panel, I&#8217;m just going to say. Did you want to add anything to that? So I was talking about this sort of double fronted marketplace, you know, students, one side, educators on the other. Anything to add?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:43] <strong>Destiny Kanno:</strong> Well, I did want to add in general that we&#8217;ve been very careful to say in all of the handbooks and landing pages, educational institutions. So that could be colleges, that could be high schools, that could be technical schools or different business schools, boot camps, wherever you&#8217;re getting educated on something that WordPress can maybe be hand in hand with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We would love you to run a WordPress Campus Connect event, so I wanted to like make sure we clarify that. And then also, anyone could put this on. A request to organise could come from like a teacher, for example, or a student even. We&#8217;re not like limiting it to local community organisers or anything like that. So if there is direct interest as well from a campus, then that&#8217;s even better because, you know, they&#8217;re going to have a venue and all they really need is like mentorship and maybe some facilitators.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then to plug in just a bit, you were like, what kind of curriculum do they have? Don&#8217;t forget, there&#8217;s Learn WordPress, you know, .org as well where folks can definitely use the materials there to craft their own curriculum or a series of workshops or whatever they&#8217;re going to put on as well. So I do want to ensure folks know that there are resources available that are free to help you with that part of the programming too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:41:00] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I&#8217;m just going to read this into the record. If you are, I don&#8217;t know how podcasts are consumed, I just know that they&#8217;re consumed in a wide variety of ways. If you are driving the car or you are walking somewhere and you think, I&#8217;ll get to this later, stop. If you know an educator somewhere, make a point to mention this to them at some point. You know, tomorrow, get home, phone them up. They&#8217;ve probably never heard of this. They&#8217;re probably not in the WordPress space. They probably don&#8217;t have the slightest intuition that this freely available stuff could step into their institution, with what sounds like minimal work required on their part.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it&#8217;s unlikely that they&#8217;re WordPressers in the same way that you are because you&#8217;re listening to this podcast. So that&#8217;s my request to you, that&#8217;s your philanthropic request of the day. Go and mention it to the people that you know, who work in these places and have connections with these places, because it won&#8217;t happen without those kind of things happening. So, sorry, Isotta, I didn&#8217;t allow you a chance to speak. I got all carried away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:42:00] <strong>Isotta Peira:</strong> Don&#8217;t worry at all, Nathan. I believe that we&#8217;ve been saying a lot already, and there is just a good amount of information around for everyone who&#8217;s listening about how this program works, how to connect with us, and how to just launch their Campus Connect series events in their cities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:42:18] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So we&#8217;ve spent a long time thinking about WP Campus Connect, but something that was dropped into the show notes, and I confess, I don&#8217;t really have a great deal of background on this, so you&#8217;re going to have to explain it in full. WordPress Credits. The name I guess suggests something, but I don&#8217;t really know what that something is. So, Isotta, if you fancy just running with that, tell us about WordPress Credits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:42:39] <strong>Isotta Peira:</strong> Of course. Big pleasure for me to share more about it. WordPress Credits, in simple words, is a contribution based practice programs by the WordPress foundation open to students to just to bridge them in the Core of WordPress. Regardless of what they&#8217;re studying, their fields, their interests, what we want to do is take one step from the WordPress skills education and show them how they can enhance, train, and gain new skills using the WordPress ecosystems, regardless their interests.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the word credits, as you said, yes, it&#8217;s just something because we want to partner with educational institutions, universities, schools, that will recognise the practice program into their students&#8217; curriculum.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A clear example, we&#8217;ve just launched a pilot with the University of Pisa in Italy for the Department of Translation and Communication. And for them, we are offering 150 hours of practice for the students. They will be connected with mentors. They&#8217;re going to have their virtual classrooms, and they&#8217;ll be guided since the beginning until the end. At the end, they&#8217;re going to build their website of WordPress, we teach them how to do it. You are going to use the Learn platform to guide them through the whole process. And they&#8217;re going to be involved in practical work within the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They get to pitch what they want to work on. So this is open for designer, translators, developers, whoever wants to practice their own skills and position themself already into the job environment. Because we noticed, I felt like livid on my skin when I was studying translation at the University of Pisa, that I had to do countless hours of practice translating things that nobody ever read, used. It was very good for me. For me it was perfect to have things to practice on, and so I could become a great translator, but I worked on stuff that nobody ever used.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the moment I joined the WordPress community in 2022 and I found out about the Polyglots team, I start thinking, hey, I could have been translating WordPress for five years and getting real life experience, exposure to a global community of professionals in the field that I&#8217;m interested, and also connection with companies with other fields that I couldn&#8217;t even imagine it existed for me as a translator.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the goal of this program is exactly to enable students around the world, regardless what they&#8217;re studying, to become, to shape their future through practice. And we, when I say we, I mean all the volunteers and contributors who are participating into this project. We have designed a path for each student where they not only get to practice the skills that are more relevant to the fields of study, but also transferable skills.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, for example, organising, working independently in a remote and async environment while keeping stakeholders updated. How to design a project, because they will have to finish the program, presenting a project that they would&#8217;ve designed, developed, and worked on. Public speaking because they would have also exposure to presenting the work to the WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And at the end of the mentorship, of course, from experienced contributors in our community, and at the end, at the wrap up, they will receive a certificate from the WordPress Foundation, certifying the hours of contribution within the program. And at that point, the educational institution they&#8217;re studying, they&#8217;re going to recognise these as a part of their curriculum.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For some universities and schools, it translates into credits. For example, for Pisa, 150 hours of contribution translating into six credits. So students can decide to skip a traditional exam and do this practice. And for other institution might look different. But the requirement for an institution to join this program is that they have to recognise this work into the students curriculum.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:47:08] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay so, dear listener, you may have noticed we shifted gears. We went from talking about WP Campus Connect to WordPress Credits, and we&#8217;ve now moved into a very different arena.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so now, I&#8217;ve never been to the University of Pisa, but I&#8217;m going to guess that, just the name itself, it&#8217;s an utterly credible institution, you know, with a long history of taking in students and requiring them to work hard in order that they get some kind of qualification at the end.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So this is very different. We are now talking about doing WordPressy things, and at the end of it, it&#8217;s equal to a proportion of the stuff that they would be doing at that university already. Now that then, I guess, implies that this is a more structured thing, that there needs to be more inspection of what&#8217;s going on, that there needs to be kind of hoops to jump through that you need to be able to credibly say, we know that this person did this. We can prove it. There&#8217;s a paper trail, and at the end of it you get, with the University of Pisa, six credits, which equals whatever that equals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So presumably there&#8217;s more backwards and forwards. Rather than the WP Campus Connect, which is more philanthropic and, you know, more community based, presumably you&#8217;ve had to have fairly lengthy conversations and dialogue with the University of Pisa so that they know that you are not giving away six credits for nothing. What&#8217;s that been like?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:48:39] <strong>Isotta Peira:</strong> Yes, you are absolutely right, and this is the case, and it is understandably, because we need to show them what is the potential, and what the students will gain. For me, it&#8217;s been a wonderful experience. And now I&#8217;m also in conversation with other universities and other schools. And having myself lived, like felt this gap between, oh, I&#8217;m doing practice, but it feels like it&#8217;s just useful to me, but it&#8217;s not applied in the real world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And seeing, hey, this could bring, just basically push all these students into creating something that not only they own, because I believe the ownership is very important because most of cases, studies are a little bit passive. So as you were saying before, we have a teacher, we sit, we listen and we do what we&#8217;re asked to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this case is the other way around. It&#8217;s, hey, this is a playground of learning opportunities for you. We show you everything that you can play with, and then you get to design the project. You get to experiment all this exposure to real life that usually you don&#8217;t get at university or another, let&#8217;s say, formal institutions. And for the universities, this is going to be, basically a certificate for institutional excellence for them, because right now, only the University of Pisa is offering this. In a few weeks, also the universities Fidélitas in Costa Rica will start offering this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So just, hey, to institutions worldwide, this is something that the university, once they understand what it is, they will want to jump on it. And so as you say, it&#8217;s a lot of back and forth. It&#8217;s always a very interesting conversation because every university has some similar and some different needs for their students. And for me it&#8217;s a huge learning curve because I&#8217;m getting to learn a lot about other institutions. But at the end, everyone who I&#8217;ve been talking to so far, they are like over the moon with the idea of offering this option, this possibility to their students.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What I&#8217;m doing right now is starting connecting with teachers, schools, universities, institution that I personally, I&#8217;m already personally connected with, like the case in Pisa. And the WordPress community is key because also, in this community, there&#8217;s plenty of teachers. Everywhere you look, there is, oh, okay, I teach WordPress, I teach this other WordPress related theme. Oh, I teach at this school, I teach at this universities. Or, hey, in my kids&#8217; school, they were looking for something like this, and it turns out that maybe you&#8217;re not a teacher, but you have kids and they&#8217;re at schools.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s been key, the connection with the community. And it&#8217;s actually one of the biggest needs that we have right now. Right now, there are three, including myself, contributors focusing on this project. We need more help, also to create this connection, to get into the institution and to have them understand the offer that we&#8217;re giving to them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:51:59] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So I&#8217;m going to read into the record a recycled version of the comment that I made a moment ago about WP Campus Connect. And that is that if you know anybody who could fit into this part of the jigsaw, you know, an educator or somebody that works in a university, whatever capacity that may be, I guess you are looking for that door to be slightly pushed ajar so that you&#8217;ve got these contacts wherever they may be. Obviously you&#8217;ve got Pisa, Costa Rica and what have you. But it would be nice to spread this a little bit further.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay. Okay, so that bit is now done. The bit that I want to ask with this is with the university students going through the WordPress Credit system, is this kind of a distributed thing? Is it something that they can do in their own time? Or do they need to, I don&#8217;t know, attend, be in a particular lecture hall at a particular time in order to prove that they&#8217;ve done a particular thing? Or is it entirely remote with, well, basically it&#8217;s a very open-ended question. How does it work from a student point of view? How do they achieve this?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:52:59] <strong>Isotta Peira:</strong> This is a great question actually. The values behind this program is to keep the open source experience as real as possible. So it is a hundred percent remote. We have built the virtual classroom for each student on the Learn platform, and they will be able to self onboard themself, go through the all the steps, but at the same time, they will be paired with the mentors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we strongly recommend, and for this first, let&#8217;s say, round of program, we are making strong suggestion to meet with their mentor once per week, so they can learn more about each other, the mentor can help them guiding their way, but they have to complete the hours. We want to, not just respect the principle of the WordPress ecosystems, but also put students in this real life environment that they will find in their job.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because most of the roles in different type of companies, you just don&#8217;t have to like stay there and show that they&#8217;re doing the things. You work at your pace. You have your project. You have to share updates, of course, and show that you are progressing. And for WordPress credits, if students want to work on weekends, during night, this is up to them. They just have to complete the WordPress site and the hours assigned.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there are couple of steps that will have them syncing at a specific moment with other parts of the community. For example, participating to a discussion on Slack, or a discussion on a blog post. Because also they&#8217;re experimenting different tool and different communication styles. And if there is a meetup, local meetup active in their cities, one of the step would also be participate to one of them. Or if there is no meetup, local meetup happening, to join an online meetup.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So in this way the success of this program would reach the most, the highest point, if they have not only completed the work they decided to do, but if they also have experienced all the different parts of the ecosystem. So this way they work out the program, and they have the new world possibility open. They can decide to stay, they can decide to just focus more on one particular thing and they would&#8217;ve learned how to upload and work on WordPress, TV. How to use tools like Slack, GitHub, WordPress, the Learn platform, everything. So this is what they will get.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:55:32] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, it&#8217;s pretty amazing. I mean, set aside the fact that when I was at university, the internet just didn&#8217;t exist because I&#8217;m of a certain age, but I would&#8217;ve loved something like this. The capacity to just sort of do things in my own time, you know, fit it around, cherry pick the bits that I want to pick. For me it was much more, you pick a course, you show up to the course, you imbibe the content, you sit and exam and so it goes. And that was what was on offer. But this is so great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And also, I don&#8217;t know if this is something that you do do but it just came into my head, the capacity for this to be an accreditation prior to gaining access to a university. So at the minute in the UK, all of the results are coming out for the examinations which children, well, young adults require in order to get to their place at university. And then when they&#8217;re at the university, they obviously get these credits and get the degree or what have you. But something like WordPress credits, it&#8217;d be kind of fun if it could count towards that onboarding process, you know, to get you in the door of a university to show up and say, I did the WordPress thing. I did something a little bit above and beyond what everybody else is doing. I mean, I don&#8217;t know if there&#8217;s any plans for that, but that struck me as a curious option.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:56:45] <strong>Isotta Peira:</strong> That would be the dream. Having WordPress credits embedded into like mandatory curriculum to get to a specific level of education, or to be able to end, to graduate from a specific level of education. This is going to be the dream. Now we&#8217;ve taken the first steps, so now we&#8217;ve built up the program, we are going to gather feedback, improve it, adjust it with all these first new batch of students that are coming. And also from the sponsors, the universities, and the mentors feedback. And then little by little, this is where we want to go. Ready to bring WordPress contributions everywhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:57:22] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, I mean, gosh, what an episode this has been. I thoroughly enjoyed this. However, I don&#8217;t know if we&#8217;re done yet because on the show notes that I had, we had three points that we were to mention. One was WP Campus Connect, which we did at the beginning, and then we&#8217;ve just spent a few moments talking about WordPress Credits. But there&#8217;s this other curious bit that I don&#8217;t know much about, and I don&#8217;t know if this is something we want to delve into, WordPress Student Clubs. What&#8217;s that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:57:47] <strong>Destiny Kanno:</strong> Yeah, so that is, you don&#8217;t have to have a WordPress Campus Connect event to request a WordPress Student Club on your campus. But it essentially was birthed out of this idea from Anand of like, hey, you know, now that we&#8217;ve got this captive audience of students, like where do they go to continue the WordPress activities after we&#8217;re gone? And so the, yeah, WordPress Student Clubs were born.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can now request a site created for your Student Club when you request to organise a WordPress Campus Connect event, or you can just reach out to us directly. And right now, I believe Anand is working with the Sophia Girls College right now in Ajmer to set up their WordPress Student Club. I think they&#8217;re the first actually to have one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the goal is that they can continue on campus, their WordPress activities. They can connect still with the local community, potentially like invite them to their student club events. It&#8217;s just like a extracurricular circle or club that now is WordPress themed that will, I think, help them continue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And also, sorry, I just wanted bring in like the Credits portion too. Like you might have folks from different majors, right, that are using WordPress in different ways. So it&#8217;s a way for also the students to intermingle amongst different majors within their campus as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:59:08] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It&#8217;s kind of a way to keep the conversation going, isn&#8217;t it, in a sense? It&#8217;s more opportunities to kind of keep people interested and give them opportunities. And all of that is just so necessary. We talked at the beginning about the age demographic of WordPress and how all of this stuff is just such a real credible way of trying to tackle that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think if you were to put somebody that went through, let&#8217;s say, WP Campus Connect. If you were to drop them straight into a meetup, maybe that&#8217;s too much, because it can get fairly technical. You know, the presentations are often about some fairly technical things, and so this feels like a really nice bridge. It keeps it more based around the students, so they&#8217;re familiar with each other. They&#8217;re in the same institution, presumably. It&#8217;s kind of like a club. We call them afterschool clubs in the UK. It feels a little bit more like that. So it&#8217;s much more based around where they already are and that kind of thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:59:59] <strong>Destiny Kanno:</strong> It gives them a sense of ownership as well, because it&#8217;s as you said, it&#8217;s a students&#8217; club, so, you know, there&#8217;s going to be someone that&#8217;s leading it, and maybe a co-lead as well, and a faculty member who will also be there to advise or assist.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[01:00:13] <strong>Anand Upadhyay:</strong> It&#8217;s kind of an in campus meetup group, that kind of thing. So they can, just like you said, taking them to the local community meetup will be a little bit overwhelming from them, because whatever the sessions, whatever the topics that are planned in the meetups stuff, catering to the wider audience. So in the campus club they can decide their own kind of topics. What are the topics they are interested in? And they can learn, it&#8217;s kind of a group learning as well. Someone from them is learning one topic and delivering this knowledge to the other club members. So it&#8217;s a way to keep the momentum going on that is started with WordPress Campus Connect program.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[01:00:51] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, it&#8217;s absolutely wonderful. I&#8217;m going to make sure, before we finally finish this call, although we&#8217;ll end the podcast recording in a moment, I&#8217;ll make sure that I ask these panelists to send me any links that may assist you. And so what I&#8217;m going to say is if you head to the wptavern.com website, and if you search for this episode, you could probably search for WP Campus Connect or WordPress Credits or what have you, certainly it&#8217;ll be there available in search.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Head to that, look at the show notes and the links. There&#8217;ll be a transcript of this and there&#8217;ll be some show notes where I just sort of summarise what&#8217;s going on. But right at the bottom, a little way down the page will be all of the links for everything that we have discussed. Maybe some additional ones as well for things that we didn&#8217;t have.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And when I attend WordPress events, there&#8217;s always a sense of this, there&#8217;s always a sense of look around, the community&#8217;s not getting any younger. We&#8217;ve got to do something about it. Complaining is the wrong word. People are not doing that, they&#8217;re just curious about that. Well, here, you&#8217;ve been spoonfed the solution. You now know what it is that you could do to skew the demographic younger. If the WordPress project is something that you believe in, and you would like to carry on, the only way to do that is to have a funnel of younger people who will become the older people, who will then teach the younger people. And so the cycle continues.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want that to happen and you don&#8217;t know how to make that happen, well, now you do. You&#8217;ve got these people to reach out to. You&#8217;ve got these projects that you know about. You can get involved in any of this, at any level.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And all that it remains for me to do is to say, wow, thank you to all three of you for being interested in this. Not just interested, being active and making the effort to get these things started, to get them off the ground, which is the hardest bit, I think. And hopefully now that they have got off the ground, they will fly with wings of their own. That would be really nice. So, Destiny, Isotta and Anand, thank you so much for chatting to me today. What an episode that was.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[01:02:55] <strong>Destiny Kanno:</strong> Thank you so much, Nathan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[01:02:57] <strong>Isotta Peira:</strong> Thank you. It&#8217;s been a huge pleasure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[01:02:59] <strong>Anand Upadhyay:</strong> And thank you for giving us a platform to share all these initiatives.</p>\n</div></details>\n\n\n\n<p>On the podcast today we have <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/piyopiyofox/\">Destiny Kanno</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/peiraisotta/\">Isotta Peira</a> and <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/anandau14/\">Anand Upadhyay</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Destiny is the head of Community Education at Automattic. Isotta is the leader of the WordPress credits initiative for students. Anand is the founder of WordPress Campus Connect.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This episode is all about how WordPress is not only powering websites but also empowering the next generation of learners and creators. You’ll hear about the growing movement of education-focused WordPress events happening worldwide, from hands-on workshops on university campuses in India, to student clubs designed to keep the momentum going after introductory events.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anand shares how WP Campus Connect is bringing WordPress directly to students, reducing barriers to entry and helping bridge the gap between academic learning and real-world tech skills. We also explore the challenges of organising these events, from convincing institutions of the value of open source, to fostering genuine community involvement among both students and educators.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Isotta then introduces us to the WordPress Credits program, an initiative that lets students turn their contributions to the WordPress ecosystem into recognised academic credit at universities like Pisa in Italy. It’s a win-win: students gain practical, resume-worthy experience, while educational institutions get a transferable, skills-focused, program that prepares learners for the jobs of the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you’re an educator, a WordPress enthusiast, or just someone who cares about open source and community, this episode is packed with actionable insights. The guests share how flexible and resilient these education initiatives are, how you can get involved, and why engaging the next generation is not just important, but essential for the continued growth and sustainability of the WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s a truly inspiring episode, and is at the intersection of so many areas of profound importance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re curious about how to bring WordPress into your local school, university, or community, or if you just want to hear how WordPress is making a difference far beyond the web, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Useful links</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/handbook/wordpress-credits-contribution-internship-program/\">WordPress Credits Program</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://gamma.app/docs/WordPress-Credits-2ul3dmv61tpover?mode=present#card-qc1u5yvi4tt7he1\">WordPress Credits: A bridge to open-source technology</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://events.wordpress.org/campusconnect/\">WordPress Campus Connect</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/\">Learn WordPress</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/community-deputy/other-event-formats/wordpress-campus-connect/#wordpress-campus-connect-student-clubs\">WordPress Student Clubs</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2025/07/introducing-wordpress-credits-a-new-contribution-internship-program-for-university-students/\">Introducing WordPress Credits: A New Contribution Internship Program for University Students</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Biographies</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Destiny Kanno</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Destiny Fox Kanno, sponsored contributor at Automattic with a focus on education within the WordPress community.

But the block paradigm shifted everything. And moreso, it shifted everything about building WordPress themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, my perspective has changed, and I’ve nestled into the camp of those calling for more blocks in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let me explain why.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A journey</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s jump back in time for a moment. Three and a half years ago, just before the release of WordPress 5.9, themers were in complete control of the front-end output of WordPress sites. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, that’s a bit of a stretch. They were actually in control of everything but the content. Of that, they mostly had styling control. It was much like the previous 18 years where you would have the freedom and flexibility to build whatever you wanted. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But in the few years leading up to that point, the landscape had begun changing. Themes had to be compatible with new types of output beyond the basic paragraphs, headings, lists, and media. The Block Editor had been on the scene for a while before WordPress 5.9, but theme authors still exercised almost all the control they had in the past.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you started building block themes, suddenly what was possible shrank very, very quickly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Want to include breadcrumbs?</em> You need to add support for a <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/x3p0-breadcrumbs/\">breadcrumbs block</a>, but which one?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Need an accordion?</em> Maybe you could manipulate the Details block, but that may not be <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/60335\">an accessible approach</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>How about including SVG icons?</em> You guessed it; you need an <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/icon-block/\">icon block</a> for that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And have you ever experienced what the UI looks like when a user doesn’t have a supported block installed?</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"WordPress post editor that shows a Table of Contents block that is not installed. It includes a message that the site doesn\'t support the block.\" class=\"wp-image-41680\" height=\"340\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/gutenbergtimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/toc-no-block.webp?resize=652%2C340&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"652\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Eeeek!</em></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-genesis-blocks-gb-notice gb-font-size-18 gb-block-notice\" style=\"color: #32373c; background-color: #3373dc;\"><div class=\"gb-notice-text\" style=\"border-color: #3373dc;\">\n<p>I’d also like to take this moment to point out that you are not allowed to bundle custom blocks in themes submitted to the official WordPress theme directory. There are <em>very</em> good reasons for this that I won’t dive into. I’m including this side note merely for context.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Gone were the days where you could just include anything and everything. It’s like painting on a canvas with a limited color palette and set of brushes when you previously had every tool at your disposal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, truly great artists can make magic happen regardless of the tools. Things like the <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/news/tag/block-bindings/\">Block Bindings API</a> can fill in some of the gaps. But some features are just darn hard without a dedicated block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before block themes, theme authors enjoyed loads of new features over the years, but how and what you could build mostly remained static, the only limitation being the technology of the day. Block themes created the potential for more people to take that first step into the world of theming without knowing any code whatsoever. And they introduced the standards that so many of the inner community had called on for so long, created better interoperability with plugins, and brought contemporary technologies to WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the cost was a limited toolset that required new ways of thinking from us old timers who’d been merrily doing our own thing for so long.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s an exciting world, but it could be more exciting in the next stage of this journey.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The case for more Core blocks</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I am a developer. I love tinkering with anything and everything. I even dabble in creating custom plugins, but my true passion is creating WordPress themes. I’ve probably written just as much on the subject as anyone over the years. It’s safe to say that I know the technical limitations of block theming as much as anyone can reasonably be expected to (though I’m still learning new things all the time).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So when Matías Ventura, the Project Architect of Gutenberg, opened a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/71026\">ticket calling for more niche blocks</a> in WordPress, it piqued my interest. The list of potential blocks were:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/16484\">Icons</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/805\">Playlist</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/43369\">Slider/Carousel</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/71017\">Stretchy Text</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/34079\">Tabs</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/21584\">Accordion</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/23745\">Mega Menus</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/47198\">MathML</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/41730\">Marquee</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/42229\">Table of Contents</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/53776\">Time to Read</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/21943\">Breadcrumbs</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/61297\">Dialog</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Admittedly, I chuckled at the thought of a Stretchy Text block actually being included in Core. But the more I dug into what it takes to actually implement the design, I could see the case for it. I certainly don’t see a good way of using it in a theme design pattern without a dedicated block.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"WordPress post editor that displays a green gradient background in the content canvas. Across the top is demo text that stretches from the far left to far right of the screen, creating a stretchy text effect.\" class=\"wp-image-41682\" height=\"340\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/gutenbergtimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/stretchy-text.webp?resize=652%2C340&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"652\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">The <a href=\"https://specialprojects.automattic.com/tools/stretchy-type/\">Stretchy Type block</a> from the Automattic Special Projects team.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>And marquees? Were they not relegated to a long dead era when Geocities ruled the blogosphere? I miss the old days of the wild and wacky web. <em>Could be fun.</em> <img alt=\"🤔\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f914.png\" style=\"height: 1em;\" /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s easy to get tangled up in the weeds, using the most niche blocks as arguments against components like accordions, tabs, dialogs, and table of contents, which are standard pieces of the web as we know it today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you recall, I said earlier that I was a longtime supporter of keeping Core lean. The old WordPress was very much a development framework. But as a theme author in the block theme era, I’ve moved much closer to the thoughts that Ventura espoused:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>I think not having these blocks in the core library severely limits the expressiveness that theme builders (and users) can depend upon to build great designs and it can fracture the overall experience.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>There have been many moments in the last three years where I’d have 95% of the work done, speeding toward the finish line of a block theme project. Then I’d smash into a brick wall. Quite often that wall was a missing design component. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve been in the development game long enough to find workarounds, but it’s been at the expense of untold hours of development time that could’ve been better spent elsewhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if I’m at the top of my game, what hope is there for newcomers who have bright ideas and big dreams? Will they be able to build that unique design they have in mind? Or will they switch to another platform?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>So…I want more blocks. </em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I want more possibilities. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I want to make ideas come to life without spending a week figuring out how to pigeonhole some feature into a place it doesn’t belong just to make things work.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">To include or not include</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I hope that you at least agree on one point: For block theming to progress, WordPress needs a mechanism for theme authors to fully express their ideas. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Everything beyond that is implementation details. Ventura’s <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/71026\">proposal for additional blocks</a> has garnered a lot of discussion over the past month both in the ticket and elsewhere around the community. There’s wide agreement and disagreement on some or all points.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chiefly, whether the more niche blocks should be bundled is of concern. Things like future compatibility, potential legacy baggage, and bundle size are worth discussing. There’s also the potential for <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/58773\">Core/Canonical blocks</a> that Ventura proposed in 2024, a set of blocks built and maintained by WordPress contributors but not shipped with the platform itself. I’d even be happy with a method of auto-installing supported blocks when a user activates a theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Frankly, I don’t much care how we get there—just that we do.

I&#8217;ll ask everyone to share their name and how long they have been involved in open source. We&#8217;ll do this <a href=\"https://www.facilitator.school/glossary/popcorn-style\">popcorn style</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next I&#8217;ll quickly review some norms for this club:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Make Space </strong>for each other — Be conscious of how much you are speaking and encourage others to speak as well. While <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/25/opinion/interrupting-cooperative-overlapping.html?searchResultPosition=1\">cooperative overlapping</a> is a conversation style that is natural to some, it&#8217;s one we should avoid in this context. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Approach this club with <strong>enthusiastic collaboration </strong>— This is a phrase that I stole from the preface and is one of the ways that the author describes the unique culture of open source. In this context the phrase means to me that everyone is coming with a positive attitude and a desire to share and learn. We will all assume good intent since everyone is approaching this with good intent. </li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Camera On by default</strong>, no questions asked if camera is off — It&#8217;s easier and more engaging if we can see each other, so I want to encourage you to have your camera on, but there are also a multitude of reasons that you may want it off. You don&#8217;t need to explain why your camera is off, but if you can, please turn it on. </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>After that we will get to the meat of the session, and discuss these two sections. I&#8217;ll bring a few questions to help get the discussion flowing, but I would also love if folks brought their own as well. Since the majority of participants don&#8217;t work in open source day in and day out, I expect some questions to be about ways to apply our learnings outside open source.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, I am going to encourage everyone to spend some time blogging their thoughts after the discussion. This can be a reaction to something you read or something discussed. It can be notes you took while reading, but I would like to encourage blogging. </p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://aaron.jorb.in/wp-book-club-week-1/\">WP Book Club Week 1</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://aaron.jorb.in\">Aaron Jorbin</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 01 Sep 2025 18:51:55 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6:\"jorbin\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:21;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:21:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"Matt: Summer WordPress Update\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:23:\"https://ma.tt/?p=149189\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://ma.tt/2025/08/wcus-2025/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1610:\"<p>I&#8217;m still buzzing from an incredible WordCamp US this week, from contributor day to the closing party the vibes were right and it was amazing to connect with fellow travelers in the journey towards creating a more free and open source internet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before our open town hall Q&amp;A I was able to make some fun announcements:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Traffic to WordPress.org is up, and we&#8217;ve brought the plugin queue from months to basically a few days.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Previewed Block Comments and the upcoming Command Palette feature in 6.9.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Shared some fun AI experiments, including <a href=\"https://github.com/felixarntz/wp-ai-sdk-chatbot-demo\">Felix&#8217;s AI chatbot demo</a>, <a href=\"https://telex.automattic.ai/\">Automattic&#8217;s new Telex block creator</a>, and more.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Got to announce details for the next two flagships:\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>WordCamp Asia 2026</strong>: Mumbai, India, from April 9<sup>th</sup> to 11<sup>th</sup>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>WordCamp Europe 2026</strong>: Kraków, Poland.

WordPress Cofounder Matt Mullenweg joined a diverse lineup of speakers, panelists, and workshop leaders who brought fresh perspectives to the open web from across the globe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Set against the vibrant backdrop of Portland — with its iconic bridges, coffee culture, and creative energy — the Sponsor Hall buzzed as companies across the WordPress ecosystem demoed new products, shared insights, and connected with attendees. Each day offered opportunities to refuel with local flavors and international favorites, turning mealtimes into lively hubs of networking and idea-sharing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A Global Gathering in Portland</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>WordCamp US is the annual gathering point for the WordPress community — where collaboration, creativity, and innovation intersect. This year in Portland, the event delivered an expansive program that reached every corner of the ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s what attendees experienced:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Engaging Sessions Across Tracks</strong> – Keynotes, presentations, and discussions explored the evolving web and the role of open source in shaping it.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>A Global Speaker Lineup</strong> – Voices from across continents brought local stories and global visions to the stage.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Wide-Ranging Topics</strong> – From AI in WordPress development to accessibility, design systems, content strategy, education, and case studies of WordPress at scale.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Hands-On Learning Opportunities</strong> – Workshops provided practical takeaways, empowering attendees to apply new skills immediately.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>A Community Built on Collaboration</strong> – Whether contributing code, exploring business strategies, or sharing creative projects, attendees found space to learn, grow, and celebrate open source together.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>New contributors took their first steps into open source, seasoned developers explored cutting-edge AI integrations, and agencies and product teams shared strategies for scaling WordPress to meet modern needs. Beyond the technical, conversations around inclusivity, sustainability, and education underscored WordPress’s role as a tool for empowerment and positive change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In hallways, coffee lines, and evening meetups, attendees found the “hallway track” alive and well, spontaneous moments of connection that often became the most memorable part of the experience. Whether reconnecting with longtime collaborators or meeting someone new, these small interactions reinforced the heart of WordCamp US: a community that thrives on openness, generosity, and shared purpose.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Contributor Day: Collaboration at the Core</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The conference opened on Tuesday, August 26, with a vibrant Contributor Day. Nearly 300 contributors filled the space, including more than 120 first-time participants who were onboarded across 19 teams. Developers, designers, translators, marketers, and community organizers worked side by side, representing WordPress expertise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Throughout the day, contributors tackled everything from improving accessibility and performance to refining documentation to enhancing translation tools. Beyond technical contributions, teams like Marketing and Community focused on outreach, mentoring, and shaping future-facing initiatives. Remote participants joined via dedicated channels, reinforcing the inclusive nature of WordPress’s global community.

experience in the room made this year especially notable. First-time contributors were paired with seasoned table leads who guided them through their first steps into open source contribution. Longtime contributors reconnected with their teams and advanced ongoing initiatives, while new voices added fresh perspectives and momentum. The spirit of mentorship was woven throughout, ensuring that Contributor Day was productive and welcoming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The results spoke for themselves:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Polyglots</strong> translated more than 12,000 strings, expanding WordPress’s accessibility worldwide.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The <strong>Community team</strong> celebrated the approval of two brand-new local meetups.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The <strong>Training team</strong> achieved its objective of updating outdated course thumbnails.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The <strong>Core team</strong> worked through a live bug scrub, with 9 committers and 16 contributors collaborating on improvements.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The <strong>Documentation team</strong> completed numerous content updates to keep resources fresh and reliable.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Momentum carried through every table, with participants reporting measurable progress and a renewed sense of shared purpose. Contributor Day once again highlighted the unique power of collaboration in shaping the open web, proving that every contribution matters through code, translations, training, or community building.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Showcase Day: WordPress in Action</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Wednesday, August 27, was the popular Showcase Day, spotlighting real-world innovation in WordPress. Initially expected to draw about 250 participants, Showcase Day welcomed more than 800 attendees — a powerful sign of how much energy and curiosity the community brought to Portland. The sessions demonstrated how WordPress powers meaningful work across industries from nonprofits to newsrooms, agencies to global enterprises, while staying true to open source values.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The day opened with a keynote by Amy Sample Ward: <em>The Tech That Comes Next</em>. Drawing from their co-authored book with Afua Bruce, Amy highlighted the inequities embedded in today’s technologies — from dataset bias to accessibility gaps — and challenged attendees to rethink how tools are funded, built, and deployed. Their talk invited technologists, funders, and community leaders to imagine a more equitable digital future, rooted in collaboration and shared responsibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>From there, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/PGvh7fCOUk0\">Joeleen Kennedy</a> of Human Made shared how Full Site Editing (FSE) shapes the refresh of Wikimedia’s ongoing user experience. Her session <em>Modernizing at Scale</em> detailed how FSE is simplifying workflows, improving accessibility, and making the multilingual platform more sustainable for the long term. Attendees gained a behind-the-scenes look at how one of the world’s largest open knowledge platforms is leveraging WordPress innovation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/F4NEPcwGRCI\">Josh Bryant</a> took the stage to explore what happens when Gutenberg leaves the WP-Admin dashboard. His talk, <em>Reimagining WordPress Editing</em>, walked through embedding the block editor into a standalone React application to support Dow Jones’s newsroom workflows. From decoupling Gutenberg to managing custom data stores, the session showcased advanced techniques for scaling editorial tools while maintaining the flexibility of the WordPress ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hands-on learning was a hallmark of Showcase Day, with Jamie Marsland’s workshop leading participants through building and launching their own professional portfolio sites — no coding required. Attendees left with a fully functioning site, demonstrating WordPress’s continued ability to empower anyone, anywhere, to publish online.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the afternoon, Jeffrey Paul’s session <em>Scalable, Ethical AI</em> addressed one of the most pressing topics in today’s digital world: how to integrate AI without sacrificing ownership, privacy, or open standards. Walking participants through practical use cases with ClassifAI and local LLMs, Paul emphasized how WordPress can help content creators harness AI while maintaining autonomy over their data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The day closed with a forward-looking community highlight: <a href=\"https://events.wordpress.org/campusconnect/\">WordPress Campus Connect</a>. Panelists <a href=\"https://youtu.be/ARqM9U0ESvo\">Destiny Kanno, Andrés Parra, Javier Montes de Blas, Mauricio Barrantes, and Elineth Morera Campos</a> shared how this initiative brings WordPress into classrooms and universities worldwide. Student Andrés Parra received a scholarship to attend WordCamp. During the panel, Elineth also announced that Fidélitas University will begin offering its students a <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2025/07/introducing-wordpress-credits-a-new-contribution-internship-program-for-university-students/\">WordPress Credits</a> program starting in October 2025, making it a mandatory addition sometime in 2026, enabling them to contribute directly to WordPress as part of their studies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By connecting students and educators with the open web, Campus Connect is building the next generation of contributors and innovators, ensuring that WordPress remains both a learning tool and a pathway to opportunity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taken together, Showcase Day affirmed that WordPress is more than just a CMS — it is a platform for equitable technology, global collaboration, cutting-edge enterprise solutions, and the future of digital education. WordPress has the power to be both a platform and a community tool for education, equity, and innovation.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Presentation Days: Learning, Inspiration, and Connection</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The first full day of sessions at WordCamp US 2025 opened with warm remarks from the organizing team, who reminded attendees: <em>“The most important thanks goes to all of you. The mix of new energy and veteran experience is what makes WordCamp so special, so thank you for being here.”</em> That spirit of gratitude and community carried throughout the event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Sponsor Hall became a hub of activity, complete with raffles, the return of Career Corner, and even a Voodoo Donut Truck parked outside. Attendees lined up to test their luck at a claw machine stuffed with plush Wapuus, while others sought guidance at the Happiness Bar — a hands-on help desk for WordPress questions big and small. Between these activities, the steady buzz of conversations made it clear: the “hallway track” remained one of WordCamp’s most valuable experiences.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The program itself set a high bar. Danny Sullivan’s keynote shed light on how search has evolved to meet the needs of new generations, from 24/7 demand and mobile expectations to short-form video and AI. His session gave attendees a deeper understanding of how search intersects with publishing today and sparked conversations about how WordPress can continue adapting in an era where AI shapes discovery and content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From there, the schedule unfolded across multiple tracks. The Core AI panel — featuring <a href=\"https://youtu.be/v_0O6dQ4Q4E\">James LePage, Felix Arntz, and Jeffrey Paul</a> — offered a look into how AI tools are woven into WordPress core. Emphasizing ethics, transparency, and user empowerment, the panel painted a roadmap for how WordPress can adopt new technologies without compromising its open-source values.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-19103\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2025/08/Programming-Day-1-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"1024\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Hands-on learning played a significant role throughout the conference. Ryan Welcher’s interactive <em>Block Developer Cookbook</em> drew a packed room as participants worked through community-selected code recipes built on the latest WordPress APIs. By the end, attendees left with working examples and practical strategies they could bring back to their projects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The program also highlighted diverse technical perspectives. <a href=\"https://youtu.be/vBjNqdacbh4\">Jemima Abu’s</a> session, <em>A PHP Developer’s Guide to ReactJS</em>, bridged the gap between classic and modern web development. At the same time, Adam Gazzaley’s keynote, <em>A New Era of Experiential Medicine – AI and the Brain</em>, invited attendees to consider the human side of technology, exploring how digital tools can advance health and well-being.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second day of presentations, Friday, August 29, opened with creativity and imagination. <a href=\"https://youtu.be/O7FPiFpRI3o\">John Maeda’s</a> keynote, <em>Cozy AI Cooking: WordCamp Edition</em>, used the metaphor of a kitchen to demystify AI, blending storytelling with technical insight to show how curiosity and care can guide builders in integrating AI into their work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Later in the day, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/ORnJTpjA-4w\">Tammie Lister’s</a> <em>The System is the Strategy</em> illustrated how design systems provide structure and scalability for growing WordPress projects. At the same time, Adam Silverstein’s Unlock Developer Superpowers with AI showcased new ways developers can use emerging tools to speed up workflows and problem-solving.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Community stories also took center stage. In Creators around a Campfire, Anne McCarthy, Jamie Marsland, Christian Taylor, Mark Szymanski, and Michael Cunningham reflected on how YouTubers and content creators shape the WordPress ecosystem. Their session highlighted the role of storytelling and education in expanding WordPress’s reach to new audiences worldwide.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Sponsor Hall remained lively between sessions — with attendees meeting companies, testing demos, and swapping ideas that extended far beyond the conference halls. They also shared moments together at the arcade built for the event and added smiles, hugs, and laughter, which underscored the atmosphere: WordCamp US was as much about connection as code.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Together Into the Future</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As the event drew to a close, WordPress Cofounder Matt Mullenweg took the stage to share the current state of WordPress and a vision for its future. He highlighted the growth in social media for WordPress with 124,726 new followers since last WCUS — and the WordPress.org website growing over 10% in users along with almost 20% in new users. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matt also spotlighted community initiatives shaping the future of open source education and diversity: WordPress Campus Connect, which has already reached 570 students across 11 events. Combined with the growth in overall events (77) which is a 32.76% increase over 2024. Each effort reinforced the message that WordPress is more than software; it is a global movement driven by people.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>He concluded with a live Q&amp;A, fielding questions from the audience on the direction of WordPress, its role in an AI-driven web, and the importance of keeping the project open, inclusive, and adaptable. The final notes of the keynote carried into a closing party in downtown Portland, where attendees capped off the week with music, conversation, and the unmistakable joy of a community coming together.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Closing</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>WordCamp US 2025 once again demonstrated what makes the WordPress ecosystem extraordinary: a community committed to building tools, resources, and opportunities that empower people everywhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This year also marked the debut of the <a href=\"https://airtable.com/appWF6hdXuEOFQMvV/shrV5RZIv0aJjjU00\">Open Horizons Scholarship</a>, which funded six recipients — two organizers, three volunteers, and one speaker — from five countries. A total of $14,670 supported their journeys to WCUS. The scholarship, which also supports participation at WordCamp Asia and WordCamp Europe, is designed to make flagship events more accessible to contributors worldwide.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A heartfelt thank you goes to the organizers, volunteers, sponsors, and speakers who brought the Portland edition to life — and to every attendee who joined us in person or followed along online. We hope you leave with fresh ideas, meaningful connections, and renewed energy to help shape the future of the open web.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default

In the 90s I was running around the Vallley trying to explain to everyone that blogging was going to change everything, all I got was blank stares from people who said &#8220;we don&#8217;t do that.&#8221; They of course eventually did do it.

This talk will look at how these performance plugins impact the speed of a stock WordPress site running the Twenty Twenty-Five default theme, using Core Web Vitals benchmarks and Lighthouse scores. It will also look at how the theme&#8217;s performance can be further tuned, including the use of core patches proposed for the next major release (also available in plugin form to leverage today) to

Next</a></li></ol></nav>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"performance-lab\">Performance Lab</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve been a WordPress <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/about/organization/#committers\">core committer</a> for <a href=\"https://weston.ruter.net/2025/05/14/a-decade-as-a-core-committer-my-wordpress-contribution-history/\">over 10 years</a>, and since Spring 2023 I&#8217;ve been heavily involved on the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/performance/handbook/about-the-team/\">Core Performance Team</a>. In addition to contributing patches directly to the WordPress core codebase, we also develop new performance optimizations in the form of feature plugins. We use our <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/performance-lab/\">Performance Lab</a> plugin as a way to collect the feature plugins we&#8217;re currently working on to facilitate discovery:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-wp-embed is-provider-plugin-directory wp-block-embed-plugin-directory\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\"><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/performance-lab/\">Performance Lab</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of these performance feature plugins are developed in the <a href=\"https://github.com/wordpress/performance\">WordPress/performance</a> monorepo on GitHub. In the same way as the Gutenberg plugin serves as a way to develop new editor features, the Performance Lab plugin is a way we incubate new performance features. It allows us to get feedback from users and test the impact prior to being proposed for merging into a new release of WordPress core when it gets rolled out to <a href=\"https://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/content_management\">~43%</a> of the web.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"case-study-twenty-twenty-five\">Case Study: Twenty Twenty-Five</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The default theme for the current version of WordPress is <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/twentytwentyfive/\">Twenty Twenty- Five</a>. Default themes in core basically encapsulate the latest and greatest in what WordPress has to offer in terms of features and performance. Indeed, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/block-themes/\">block themes</a> are generally faster than classic themes (especially with page caching) for a few reasons, including:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Scripts and styles are <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/07/01/block-styles-loading-enhancements-in-wordpress-5-8/\">selectively loaded</a> based on whether their blocks actually used on the page.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Blocks are more likely to use the <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/interactivity-api/\">Interactivity API</a> which involves deferred <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2024/03/04/script-modules-in-6-5/\">script modules</a> (which don&#8217;t block rendering) and <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/interactivity-api/core-concepts/server-side-rendering/\">server-side rendering</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>So the Twenty Twenty-Five theme should be very fast, and indeed it is. But with Performance Lab features (and beyond), it can be made even faster.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your mileage will vary with other themes, either having an even greater impact or a lesser one. Every site is unique (hopefully!) and so the impact of optimizations depends on a page&#8217;s contents, how a theme is built, and which plugins are active. But in this post, I&#8217;ll show the impact of the optimizations in various page layouts of the Twenty Twenty-Five Theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"performance-testing-methodology\">Performance Testing Methodology</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps the most popular way to analyze the performance of a webpage is to use <a href=\"https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview/\">Lighthouse</a>, either <a href=\"https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview#devtools\">in Chrome DevTools</a> or via the bottom half of <a href=\"https://pagespeed.web.dev/\">PageSpeed Insights</a>. Lighthouse allows you to test pages either as a desktop or mobile device, <a href=\"https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse#why-is-the-performance-score-so-low-it-looks-fine-to-me\">emulating</a> the viewport, CPU, and connection speed. Lighthouse is an important tool to get a sense of a page&#8217;s performance, but it has limitations. It captures data from a single page load on a simulated device. There is often <a href=\"https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse?tab=readme-ov-file#why-does-the-performance-score-change-so-much\">variability</a> in the results, and it also doesn&#8217;t reflect the experience of real users which is what you&#8217;d get from Real User Monitoring (RUM), such as in the <a href=\"https://developer.chrome.com/docs/crux\">Chrome User Experience Report</a> (CrUX)—shown in the first section of PageSpeed Insights. Lighthouse provides simulated <a href=\"https://web.dev/articles/lab-and-field-data-differences#lab_data\">lab data</a> whereas CrUX provides real <a href=\"https://web.dev/articles/lab-and-field-data-differences#field_data\">field data</a>, which is more accurate. Nevertheless, field data can take a long time to collect and it can be difficult to do A/B tests at scale to capture the before/after performance impacts. That said, CrUX is definitely used to track the performance of new WordPress releases overall, as <a href=\"https://felix-arntz.me/\">Felix Arntz</a> shared the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/12/19/wordpress-performance-impact-on-core-web-vitals-in-2023/\">WordPress performance impact on Core Web Vitals in 2023</a>. Felix also wrote up how to <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2024/04/05/conducting-wordpress-performance-research-in-the-field/\">conduct WordPress performance research in the field</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the purposes of measuring the impact of performance optimizations here, lab data will be more practical because the results are available in real time, without having to wait for real users to provide field data. And I&#8217;m interested in relative performance impacts, not necessarily absolute ones. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Running a Lighthouse audit before and after a Performance Lab feature plugin is active is a way to measure the impact of the optimization. However, given variability in the results, it can be difficult to be certain of the improvement. A Lighthouse audit may no longer flag an area for improvement, but the overall Lighthouse score may be unchanged. Indeed, even a Lighthouse score of 100 doesn&#8217;t mean the page performance is “perfect”.

LCP metric is <a href=\"https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/performance/performance-scoring\">weighted</a> at 25% of the total Lighthouse score. As noted in how <a href=\"https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/performance/performance-scoring\">how Lighthouse scores are determined</a>:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>The metric value for LCP represents the time duration between the user initiating the page load and the page rendering its primary content. Based on real website data, top-performing sites render LCP in about 1,220ms, so that metric value is mapped to a score of 99.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>A 1.2 second LCP is 12 times slower than a 100 ms LCP, where 100 ms is a <a href=\"https://www.nngroup.com/articles/response-times-3-important-limits/#:~:text=0.1%20second%20is%20about%20the%20limit%20for%20having%20the%20user%20feel%20that%20the%20system%20is%20reacting%20instantaneously%2C%20meaning%20that%20no%20special%20feedback%20is%20necessary%20except%20to%20display%20the%20result.\">proposed</a> threshold for the user to perceive a reaction as being instantaneous. Nevertheless, a “good” LCP value is 2.5 seconds and below:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img alt=\"LCP (Largest Contentful Paint).

The longer it takes the server to respond with the generated HTML document, the more this will hurt the LCP metric. A slow TTFB means you are less likely to have a good LCP. If a site has a 1.5-second TTFB which needs improvement, then this leaves only 1 second for the LCP element to be rendered to get a good LCP metric. A good TTFB is considered to be about half that, at 800 ms and below:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img alt=\"TTFB (Time To First Byte).

This means it is all too likely that a 1.5-second TTFB is the norm for WordPress sites. This is in part what contributes to WordPress lagging behind most other CMSes for the LCP metric <a href=\"https://lookerstudio.google.com/s/k9MqdchHqw4\">on mobile</a> and <a href=\"https://lookerstudio.google.com/s/j4AmmUaraQM\">on desktop</a>, even about 10% below the average on all measured sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In comparison with the other CWV metrics—<a href=\"https://web.dev/articles/cls\">Cumulative Layout Shift</a> (CLS) and <a href=\"https://web.dev/articles/inp\">Interaction to Next Paint</a> (INP)—WordPress is doing worse in terms of LCP, as evident in the metric passing rates from the following <a href=\"https://httparchive.org/reports/techreport/landing\">reports</a> on HTTP Archive:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-regular\"><table><thead><tr><th class=\"has-text-align-right\">Device</th><th class=\"has-text-align-center\">LCP</th><th class=\"has-text-align-center\">CLS</th><th class=\"has-text-align-center\">INP</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class=\"has-text-align-right\"><a href=\"https://httparchive.org/reports/techreport/tech?client=mobile&amp;tech=WordPress&amp;geo=ALL&amp;rank=ALL&amp;page=1#good-cwvs\">Mobile</a></td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\">53%</td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\">83%</td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\">86%</td></tr><tr><td class=\"has-text-align-right\"><a href=\"https://httparchive.org/reports/techreport/tech?client=desktop&amp;tech=WordPress&amp;geo=ALL&amp;rank=ALL&amp;page=1#good-cwvs\">Desktop</a></td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\">64%</td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\">71%</td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\">98%</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, improving LCP remains the most important focus for performance optimizations in WordPress. So in this post I&#8217;ll focus on the LCP impact for the plugins featured in Performance Lab and some other changes proposed for WordPress 6.9.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"benchmarking\">Benchmarking</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Because the Lighthouse score is variable and a 100 score merely reflects a “good” LCP, evaluating the performance benefit of an optimization requires measuring the LCP metric itself. Due to the variability in the metric, it&#8217;s important to obtain the median value of the LCP over many measurements. By capturing the median LCP value before and after an optimization is applied, the relative impact on performance can be measured.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The tool I use for benchmarking LCP is in the <a href=\"https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/wpp-research\">GoogleChromeLabs/​wpp-research</a> repo, which my team developed when I was at Google. Specifically, I use the <code><a href=\"https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/wpp-research/tree/main/cli#benchmark-web-vitals\">benchmark-web-vitals</a></code> command which includes the ability to emulate mobile and desktop devices, network connections, and CPU speeds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s an example command I use to benchmark two URLs emulating a mobile device on a Fast 4G connection, and compare their results:</p>\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><span><code class=\"hljs language-javascript\">npm run research -- benchmark-web-vitals \\\n	--url=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"http://localhost/?enable_plugins=none\"</span> \\\n	--url=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"http://localhost/?enable_plugins=foo\"</span> \\\n	--number=<span class=\"hljs-number\">50</span> \\\n	--network-conditions=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"Fast 4G\"</span> \\\n	--emulate-device=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"Moto G4\"</span> \\\n	--diff \\\n	--output=md</code></span></pre>\n\n\n<details class=\"wp-block-details is-layout-flow wp-block-details-is-layout-flow\">Helper mu-plugin to override active plugins via query vars\n<p>I threw this together to help me with benchmarking so that I didn&#8217;t have to manually activate/deactivate plugins constantly.</p>\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><span><code class=\"hljs language-php\"><span class=\"hljs-meta\">&lt;?php</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-comment\">/**\n * Plugin Name: Active Plugins Override\n */</span>\n\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">namespace</span> <span class=\"hljs-title\">ActivePluginsOverride</span>;\n\n<span class=\"hljs-function\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"hljs-title\">get_always_active_plugins</span><span class=\"hljs-params\">()</span>: <span class=\"hljs-title\">array</span> </span>{\n	<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">return</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">array</span>(\n		<span class=\"hljs-string\">\'user-switching/user-switching.php\'</span>\n	);\n}\n\nadd_filter(\n	<span class=\"hljs-string\">\'option_active_plugins\'</span>,\n	<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">static</span> <span class=\"hljs-function\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"hljs-params\">( $plugins )</span> </span>{\n		<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">return</span> array_unique( array_merge( $plugins, get_always_active_plugins() ) );\n	},\n	<span class=\"hljs-number\">100</span>\n);\n\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">if</span> ( <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">isset</span>( $_GET&#91;<span class=\"hljs-string\">\'disable_all_plugins\'</span>] ) || ( <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">isset</span>( $_GET&#91;<span class=\"hljs-string\">\'enable_plugins\'</span>] ) &amp;&amp; $_GET&#91;<span class=\"hljs-string\">\'enable_plugins\'</span>] === <span class=\"hljs-string\">\'none\'</span> ) ) {\n	add_filter( <span class=\"hljs-string\">\'option_active_plugins\'</span>, <span class=\"hljs-string\">\'__return_empty_array\'</span> );\n}\n\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">if</span> ( <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">isset</span>( $_GET&#91;<span class=\"hljs-string\">\'disable_plugins\'</span>] ) ) {\n	<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">if</span> ( is_array( $_GET&#91;<span class=\"hljs-string\">\'disable_plugins\'</span>] ) ) {\n		$disable_plugins = $_GET&#91;<span class=\"hljs-string\">\'disable_plugins\'</span>];\n	} <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">else</span> {\n		$disable_plugins = explode( <span class=\"hljs-string\">\',\'</span>, $_GET&#91;<span class=\"hljs-string\">\'disable_plugins\'</span>] );\n	}\n\n	add_filter(\n		<span class=\"hljs-string\">\'option_active_plugins\'</span>,\n		<span class=\"hljs-function\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"hljs-params\">( $active_plugins )</span> <span class=\"hljs-title\">use</span> <span class=\"hljs-params\">( $disable_plugins )</span> </span>{\n			<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">return</span> array_merge(\n				array_filter(\n					$active_plugins,\n					<span class=\"hljs-function\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"hljs-params\">( $active_plugin )</span> <span class=\"hljs-title\">use</span> <span class=\"hljs-params\">( $disable_plugins )</span> </span>{\n						$slug = strtok( $active_plugin, <span class=\"hljs-string\">\'/\'</span> );\n						<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">return</span> !

Note this “LCP-TTFB” metric is simply the LCP metric minus the TTFB metric; this allows for measuring the client-side contributions to LCP by discounting any server-side variability in generating the response. The LCP-TTFB metric is important considering the lack of page caching on a local environment, and that certain optimizations may increase TTFB when page caching is not involved. For WordPress to scale, it&#8217;s important to have some <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/advanced-administration/performance/cache/\">page caching layer</a> in place.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"analyzing-optimization-impact-on-lcp\">Analyzing Optimization Impact on LCP</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m going to analyze the impact of the following feature plugins featured in Performance Lab:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https://weston.ruter.net/category/wordpress/feed/#image-placeholders\">Image Placeholders</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://weston.ruter.net/category/wordpress/feed/#modern-image-formats\">Modern Image Formats</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://weston.ruter.net/category/wordpress/feed/#enhanced-responsive-images\">Enhanced Responsive Images</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://weston.ruter.net/category/wordpress/feed/#image-prioritizer\">Image Prioritizer</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://weston.ruter.net/category/wordpress/feed/#speculative-loading\">Speculative Loading</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li id=\"view-transitions\"><a href=\"https://weston.ruter.net/category/wordpress/feed/#view-transitions\">View Transitions</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not covering <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/performant-translations/\">Performant Translations</a> since it was mostly <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/11/08/merging-performant-translations-into-core/\">merged</a> into core as of 6.5. I&#8217;m also not covering <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/embed-optimizer/\">Embed Optimizer</a> since it primarily helps with <abbr title=\"Interaction to Next Paint\">INP</abbr> by lazy-loading and <abbr title=\"Cumulative Layout Shfit\">CLS</abbr> by reserving space for resizing embeds; the LCP improvement is difficult to measure for embeds that appear in the initial viewport given their cross-origin nature. Lastly, I&#8217;m not covering <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/web-worker-offloading/\">Web Worker Offloading</a> since it is quite experimental and it is only related to <abbr title=\"Interaction to Next Paint\">INP</abbr>. However, I am going to cover enhancements beyond Performance Lab being targeted for WordPress 6.9:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https://weston.ruter.net/category/wordpress/feed/#nocache-bfcache\">No-cache BFCache</a> (actually, brand new to Performance Lab)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://weston.ruter.net/category/wordpress/feed/#script-module-deprioritization\">Script Module Deprioritization</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://weston.ruter.net/category/wordpress/feed/#minified-css-inlining\">Minified CSS Inlining</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The first four Performance Lab feature plugins are all related to images. In focusing on improving the LCP metric, this makes sense because images are the LCP element 73.3% of the time on mobile and 83.3% of the time on desktop, <a href=\"https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2024/performance#lcp-content-types\">according</a> to Web Almanac 2024:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large wp-lightbox-container\"><img alt=\"Bar chart showing the top LCP content types for desktop and mobile in 2024.

User-perceived performance is also important, as long as it doesn&#8217;t negatively impact LCP (which should hopefully not conflict). We&#8217;ll revisit this later with <a href=\"https://weston.ruter.net/category/wordpress/feed/#view-transitions\">View Transitions</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\" style=\"height: 100px;\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"modern-image-formats\">Modern Image Formats</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-wp-embed is-provider-plugin-directory wp-block-embed-plugin-directory\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\"><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/webp-uploads/\">Modern Image Formats</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Modern image formats, like WebP and AVIF, are able to compress much higher compared to older formats like JPEG and PNG. For example, an image compressed with AVIF could be 50% smaller than a JPEG with similar visual quality. It stands to reason that if an image is smaller, then it will take less time to download, and the LCP metric will be improved since the image can render sooner. This also addresses a common audit you encounter in Lighthouse to <a href=\"https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/performance/uses-webp-images\">serve images in next-gen formats</a>:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large has-custom-border wp-lightbox-container\"><img alt=\"Serve images in next-gen formats — Est savings of 46 KiB\n\nImage formats like WebP and AVIF often provide better compression than PNG or JPEG, which means faster downloads and less data consumption.

This <a href=\"https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/8008\">new part</a> of the HTML spec lets the browser compute the responsive sizes because lazy-loaded images are loaded after the page has been laid out. This enhancement <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2024/10/18/auto-sizes-for-lazy-loaded-images-in-wordpress-6-7/\">landed</a> in WordPress 6.7. Since then, the scope of the plugin has changed to improve the calculation of the responsive <code>sizes</code> attribute for images which are not lazy-loaded.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By default, WordPress uses the same formula for constructing the default <code>sizes</code> attribute for all images. For example, if an image is 1024 pixels wide, then the <code>sizes</code> attribute is set to:</p>\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><span><code class=\"hljs language-plaintext\">(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px</code></span></pre>\n\n\n<p>This is problematic, however, because if the image takes up half the width of the screen, then the browser will select the image URL from the <code>srcset</code> attribute for the size corresponding to the width of the viewport, not the width of the actual <code>IMG</code> element. This is often fine on mobile when images are more often taking up the full page width, but on desktop viewports it means a much larger image will be downloaded than is appropriate for the container size. For example, consider these images in a Columns block (sourced from Wikipedia, as linked):</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns is-not-stacked-on-mobile is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-28f84493 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:American_bison_k5680-1.jpg\"><img alt=\"A Bison standing among grasses looking toward the camera.\" class=\"wp-image-34617 not-transparent\" height=\"457\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/weston.ruter.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/American_bison_k5680-1.jpg?resize=700%2C457&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"700\" /></a></figure>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Bison_bison_Wichita_Mountain_Oklahoma.jpg\"><img alt=\"Bison bison at the Wichita Mountain Wildlife Refuge in Oklahoma.\" class=\"wp-image-36065 not-transparent\" height=\"507\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/weston.ruter.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Bison_bison_Wichita_Mountain_Oklahoma.jpg?resize=700%2C507&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"700\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:The_last_of_the_Canadian_buffaloes_Photo_No_580_(HS85-10-13487).jpg\"><img alt=\"The last of the Canadian buffaloes.\" class=\"wp-image-36066 not-transparent\" height=\"483\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/weston.ruter.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/The_last_of_the_Canadian_buffaloes_Photo_No_580_HS85-10-13487.jpg?resize=700%2C483&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"700\" /></a></figure>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>These images were all resized to be 1024 pixels wide, and so using the default WordPress scheme, they all have the same <code>sizes</code> attribute (as shown above), in spite of the fact that the first <code>IMG</code> element is twice the width of the second and third, and 1024px itself is about double the entire 645px width of the root Columns block on desktop. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Lighthouse, the <a href=\"https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/performance/uses-responsive-images\">properly size images</a> audit correctly identifies these images as having inaccurate <code>sizes</code>:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large has-custom-border wp-lightbox-container\"><img alt=\"Properly size images — Est savings of 226 KiB\n\nServe images that are appropriately-sized to save cellular data and improve load time.

However, on mobile it&#8217;s actually the third image which is the largest (and the LCP element) since it appears on a row by itself:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-28f84493 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large has-custom-border wp-lightbox-container\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"has-border-color has-accent-6-border-color wp-image-36126 not-transparent\" height=\"455\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/weston.ruter.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gallery-block-with-lcp-element-on-desktop.png?resize=700%2C455&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"700\" /><button class=\"lightbox-trigger\" type=\"button\">\n			<svg fill=\"none\" height=\"12\" viewBox=\"0 0 12 12\" width=\"12\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n				<path d=\"M2 0a2 2 0 0 0-2 2v2h1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 1 .5-.5h2V0H2Zm2 10.5H2a.5.5 0 0 1-.5-.5V8H0v2a2 2 0 0 0 2 2h2v-1.5ZM8 12v-1.5h2a.5.5 0 0 0 .5-.5V8H12v2a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H8Zm2-12a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v2h-1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 0-.5-.5H8V0h2Z\" fill=\"#fff\">\n			</svg>\n		</button><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Desktop layout</figcaption></figure>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large has-custom-border wp-lightbox-container\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"has-border-color has-accent-6-border-color wp-image-36127 not-transparent\" height=\"700\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/weston.ruter.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gallery-block-with-lcp-element-on-mobile.png?resize=394%2C700&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"394\" /><button class=\"lightbox-trigger\" type=\"button\">\n			<svg fill=\"none\" height=\"12\" viewBox=\"0 0 12 12\" width=\"12\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n				<path d=\"M2 0a2 2 0 0 0-2 2v2h1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 1 .5-.5h2V0H2Zm2 10.5H2a.5.5 0 0 1-.5-.5V8H0v2a2 2 0 0 0 2 2h2v-1.5ZM8 12v-1.5h2a.5.5 0 0 0 .5-.5V8H12v2a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H8Zm2-12a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v2h-1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 0-.5-.5H8V0h2Z\" fill=\"#fff\">\n			</svg>\n		</button><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Mobile layout</figcaption></figure>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Nevertheless, WordPress core adds <code>fetchpriority=​high</code> to the <em>first</em> <code>IMG</code>, of the bison and calf, even though it is never the LCP element. WordPress adds the <code>fetchpriority</code> attribute to the first sufficiently-large image it finds on the page, making a best guess as to which is the LCP element. But even when core does add the attribute to the right image on a desktop viewport, it could be wrong for mobile, and vice versa. In <a href=\"https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/wpp-research/pull/73\">my research</a>, when WordPress core correctly adds the <code>fetchpriority</code> attribute to the LCP <code>IMG</code> element on desktop or mobile, I found that 37% of those pages have a different <code>IMG</code> which is the LCP element for the other viewport. This means it&#8217;s only safe to use the <code>fetchpriority</code> attribute on <code>IMG</code> tags when they are the LCP element on <em>both</em> desktop and mobile (and tablet too). But WordPress doesn&#8217;t know how the page is laid out (although this is starting to change in the case of block themes, as with Enhanced Responsive Images above). This is where Optimization Detective comes in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Optimization Detective plugin provides a framework to capture measurements from site visitors about what elements are displayed on a page across a variety of device form factors and responsive breakpoints (e.g. desktop, tablet, and mobile). These measurements are stored in “URL Metrics” (a custom post type) which can then be used by extensions, like Image Prioritizer, to apply more accurate optimizations. In this case, Image Prioritizer:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Removes <code>fetchpriority=​high</code> from the first <code>IMG</code> in the Gallery.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Adds responsive preload <code>LINK</code> tags for the actual LCP element based on media queries.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, the following <code>LINK</code> tags are added to the page:</p>\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><span><code class=\"hljs language-xml shcb-code-table\"><span class=\"shcb-loc\"><span><span class=\"hljs-tag\">&lt;<span class=\"hljs-name\">link</span></span>\n</span></span><span class=\"shcb-loc\"><span><span class=\"hljs-tag\"> <span class=\"hljs-attr\">rel</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"preload\"</span> <span class=\"hljs-attr\">as</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"image\"</span> <span class=\"hljs-attr\">fetchpriority</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"high\"</span></span>\n</span></span><span><span class=\"hljs-tag\"> <span class=\"hljs-attr\">href</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\".../bison-2.jpg\"</span></span>\n</span><span class=\"shcb-loc\"><span><span class=\"hljs-tag\"> <span class=\"hljs-attr\">imagesrcset</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"...\"</span> <span class=\"hljs-attr\">imagesizes</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"...\"</span></span>\n</span></span><span><span class=\"hljs-tag\"> <span class=\"hljs-attr\">media</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"screen and (width &lt;= 480px)\"</span></span>\n</span><span class=\"shcb-loc\"><span><span class=\"hljs-tag\">&gt;</span>\n</span></span><span class=\"shcb-loc\"><span><span class=\"hljs-tag\">&lt;<span class=\"hljs-name\">link</span></span>\n</span></span><span class=\"shcb-loc\"><span><span class=\"hljs-tag\"> <span class=\"hljs-attr\">rel</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"preload\"</span> <span class=\"hljs-attr\">as</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"image\"</span> <span class=\"hljs-attr\">fetchpriority</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"high\"</span></span>\n</span></span><span><span class=\"hljs-tag\"> <span class=\"hljs-attr\">href</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\".../bison-3.jpg\"</span></span>\n</span><span class=\"shcb-loc\"><span><span class=\"hljs-tag\"> <span class=\"hljs-attr\">imagesrcset</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"...\"</span> <span class=\"hljs-attr\">imagesizes</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"...\"</span></span>\n</span></span><span><span class=\"hljs-tag\"> <span class=\"hljs-attr\">media</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"screen and (782px &lt; width)\"</span></span>\n</span><span class=\"shcb-loc\"><span><span class=\"hljs-tag\">&gt;</span>\n</span></span></code></span></pre>\n\n\n<p>Note how the first <code>LINK</code> preloads the second bison image on mobile, but the second <code>LINK</code> preloads the third bison image on desktop.

This is a very common way that imagery is added in page builders. Background images are also present in WordPress core, such as in some classic themes&#8217; header images; background images are also on any WordPress site using the Cover block when using a fixed background or when adding a background image to a Group block. The prevalence of non-<code>IMG</code> LCP images is captured in this <a href=\"https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2022/performance#lcp-content-types\">data presented</a> in Web Almanac 2022, showing that the <code>DIV</code> (presumably with a background image) is the LCP element ~26% of the time compared with an <code>IMG</code> at 42% of the time:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large wp-lightbox-container\"><img alt=\"Bar chart showing IMG is the LCP element on 47% of desktop pages and 42% of mobile pages, DIV on 28% and 26% respectively, P on 6% and 9%, H1 on 3% and 5%, undetected on 3% and 3%, SECTION on 3% and 3%, H2 on 1% and 2%, A on 1% and 2%, SPAN on 1% and 1%, H3 on 0% and 1%, HEADER on 1% and 1%, LI on 1% and 1%, RS-SBG on 1% and 1%, TD on 1% and 1%, VIDEO on 0% and 0%, and finally H4 is the LCP element type on 0% of both desktop and mobile pages.\" class=\"wp-image-36141 not-transparent\" height=\"700\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/weston.ruter.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/top-lcp-element-types.png?resize=598%2C700&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"598\" /><button class=\"lightbox-trigger\" type=\"button\">\n			<svg fill=\"none\" height=\"12\" viewBox=\"0 0 12 12\" width=\"12\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n				<path d=\"M2 0a2 2 0 0 0-2 2v2h1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 1 .5-.5h2V0H2Zm2 10.5H2a.5.5 0 0 1-.5-.5V8H0v2a2 2 0 0 0 2 2h2v-1.5ZM8 12v-1.5h2a.5.5 0 0 0 .5-.5V8H12v2a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H8Zm2-12a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v2h-1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 0-.5-.5H8V0h2Z\" fill=\"#fff\">\n			</svg>\n		</button><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">The percent of pages that have a given element as its LCP.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The problem with the <code>background-image</code> style is that it is CSS: there is no way for core to attach a <code>fetchpriority=​high</code> HTML attribute as can be done for LCP <code>IMG</code> candidates. Take the following page for example, where there is a parallax Cover block at the beginning of the content, followed by some paragraphs of text, and finally a Gallery block with five images in it. The black rectangle denotes the desktop viewport:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignwide size-large\"><img alt=\"Depicting a desktop viewport with a Cover block at the top of the page, followed by paragraphs of text, and a Gallery block at the bottom of the page outside of desktop viewport.\" class=\"wp-image-36152 not-transparent\" height=\"349\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/weston.ruter.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/parallax-cover-as-lcp-with-gallery-outside-viewport-cropped.png?resize=700%2C349&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"700\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center has-small-font-size\">Cover image courtesy <a href=\"https://www.pexels.com/photo/brown-buffalo-on-green-grass-field-8148551/\">Gintare</a> K. on Pexels.

Nevertheless, WordPress core is adding <code>fetchpriority=​high</code> to the first <code>IMG</code> in the Gallery block because it is the first sufficiently large image, just in terms of its <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> attributes. Additionally, WordPress core omits <code>loading=lazy</code> from the first three content images (the first three images in the Gallery), but they are not even visible on either the desktop or mobile viewports. The effect here is that the first three images of the Gallery are all loaded first <em>before</em> the all-important background image for the Cover block. Image Prioritizer fixes this by:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Removing <code>fetchpriority=​high</code> from the first <code>IMG</code> in the Gallery, since it is not the LCP element.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Adding <code>loading=lazy</code> to the first three <code>IMG</code> tags in the Gallery, since none of them are visible in any initial viewport.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Adding a preload <code>LINK</code> for the CSS <code>background-image</code> so that it is properly prioritized.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>The preload <code>LINK</code> looks like the following:</p>\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><span><code class=\"hljs language-xml\"><span class=\"hljs-tag\">&lt;<span class=\"hljs-name\">link</span>\n <span class=\"hljs-attr\">rel</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"preload\"</span>\n <span class=\"hljs-attr\">as</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"image\"</span>\n <span class=\"hljs-attr\">fetchpriority</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"high\"</span>\n <span class=\"hljs-attr\">href</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\".../bison.jpg\"</span>\n <span class=\"hljs-attr\">media</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"screen\"</span>\n&gt;</span></code></span></pre>\n\n\n<p>Unlike with the responsive image prioritization, the Cover block here is the LCP element for both desktop and mobile, so here there is only one <code>LINK</code> and the <code>media</code> attribute doesn&#8217;t need to add any viewport constraints.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here is the performance impact:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table benchmark-web-vitals\"><table><thead><tr><th>Metric</th><th>Before</th><th>After</th><th>Diff (ms)</th><th>Diff (%)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>FCP</td><td>436.5</td><td>433.9</td><td>-2.7</td><td>-0.6%</td></tr><tr><td>LCP</td><td>1042.4</td><td>579.8</td><td>-462.7</td><td><strong>-44.4%</strong></td></tr><tr><td>TTFB</td><td>49.0</td><td>53.1</td><td>+4.1</td><td>+8.4%</td></tr><tr><td>LCP-TTFB</td><td>994.6</td><td>526.9</td><td>-467.7</td><td>-47.0%</td></tr></tbody></table><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Benchmark results for 50 requests each, before and after, emulating Moto G4 over Fast 4G connection.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<details class=\"wp-block-details is-layout-flow wp-block-details-is-layout-flow\">Benchmark command<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><span><code class=\"hljs language-javascript\">npm run research -- benchmark-web-vitals \\\n	--url=https:<span class=\"hljs-comment\">//wcus-perf-talk-demo.local/2025/08/04/cover-block/?disable_all_plugins \\</span>\n	--url=https:<span class=\"hljs-comment\">//wcus-perf-talk-demo.local/2025/08/04/cover-block/?enable_plugins=image-prioritizer \\</span>\n	--number=<span class=\"hljs-number\">50</span> \\\n	--network-conditions=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"Fast 4G\"</span> \\\n	--emulate-device=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"Moto G4\"</span> \\\n	--diff \\\n	--output=md</code></span></pre></details>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the second-best improvement to LCP I&#8217;ve shown here in analyzing these plugins.

This was a feature plugin actually to bring the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Speculation_Rules_API\">Speculation Rules API</a> to WordPress core, which was <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2025/03/06/speculative-loading-in-6-8/\">merged</a> in 6.8. This API allows pages to either:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Prefetch a link, reducing TTFB to zero.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Prerender a link, potentially reducing LCP to zero.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>As such, Speculative Loading is somewhat cheating at performance because you can&#8217;t get any faster at loading something than to have it already loaded.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The degree by which TTFB and LCP are improved is largely dependent on the “eagerness” of the speculation. There are three main eagerness values for when speculation starts:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Conservative: when you pointer-down on a link.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Moderate: when you hover over a link (or <a href=\"https://issues.chromium.org/issues/372053392\">soon</a> on mobile when a link is in the viewport).</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Eager: right away without any user interaction. </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>For the initial core merge, the default cautious configuration was to use prefetch with conservative eagerness. Conservative eagerness was to avoid unused speculations which can overly tax under-powered servers, and prefetching was to avoid potential compatibility issues with prerendering, such as with analytics or ads.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s the impact that the various configurations of Speculative Loading have on LCP:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group is-content-justification-center is-nowrap is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-23441af8 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex block-visibility-hide-small-screen\" id=\"play-all-button-row\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-buttons is-layout-flex wp-block-buttons-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-button\"><button class=\"wp-block-button__link has-text-align-center wp-element-button\" type=\"button\">Play All</button></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<noscript>\n  \n</noscript>\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns alignwide is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-28f84493 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\" id=\"speculative-loading-videos\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>No Speculation</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center has-text-color has-link-color has-xx-large-font-size wp-elements-b5fdba613d5f54f529164d484d92f964\" style=\"color: #388e3c;\"><strong>2.17 s</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-video aligncenter\"><video controls=\"controls\" height=\"1080\" poster=\"https://weston.ruter.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/speculative-loading-0-poster-source.png\" src=\"https://weston.ruter.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/speculative-loading-1-none-8s.mp4\" width=\"914\"></video><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">(experience in 6.7)</figcaption></figure>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Conservative Prefetch</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center has-text-color has-link-color has-xx-large-font-size wp-elements-4d5479e34dcbef7f8a0893f1cf0b6b4e\" style=\"color: #388e3c;\"><strong>2.12 s</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-video aligncenter\"><video controls=\"controls\" height=\"1080\" poster=\"https://weston.ruter.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/speculative-loading-0-poster-source.png\" src=\"https://weston.ruter.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/speculative-loading-2-conservative-prefetch-8s.mp4\" width=\"914\"></video><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">2.3% reduction in LCP<br />(default as of WP 6.8)</figcaption></figure>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Moderate Prefetch</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center has-text-color has-link-color has-xx-large-font-size wp-elements-12afbcabcb1015bd3dd64bd0c56507e3\" style=\"color: #388e3c;\"><strong>1.04 s</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-video aligncenter\"><video controls=\"controls\" height=\"1080\" poster=\"https://weston.ruter.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/speculative-loading-0-poster-source.png\" src=\"https://weston.ruter.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/speculative-loading-3-moderate-prefetch-8s.mp4\" width=\"914\"></video><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">52.1%% reduction in LCP</figcaption></figure>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Moderate Prerender</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center has-text-color has-link-color has-xx-large-font-size wp-elements-878b05b2c5f120b82213be7b98b2888a\" style=\"color: #388e3c;\"><strong>0.04 s</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-video aligncenter\"><video controls=\"controls\" height=\"1080\" poster=\"https://weston.ruter.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/speculative-loading-0-poster-source.png\" src=\"https://weston.ruter.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/speculative-loading-4-moderate-prerender-8s.mp4\" width=\"914\"></video><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">98.2% reduction in LCP</figcaption></figure>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Navigation with prerendering results in a practically instantaneous page load with a near zero LCP!

This is great, but it&#8217;s almost too good. The navigation can feel so instant as to be abrupt. There can also be a white flicker between the page loads. To help in part with having too much of a good thing, the newest plugin to be featured in Performance Lab is <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/view-transitions/\">View Transitions</a>. There is a new web platform feature for <a href=\"https://developer.chrome.com/docs/web-platform/view-transitions/cross-document\">cross-document view transitions for multi-page applications</a>, and this plugin brings these smooth page navigation animations to WordPress. With Speculative Loading and View Transitions, navigating around a regular multi-page WordPress site can feel as fluid as a single-page app (and without all the implementation complexity).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take a look at the impact on the user experience when navigating between the homepage and a blog post:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns is-not-stacked-on-mobile is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-28f84493 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-video aligncenter\"><video controls=\"controls\" height=\"1080\" loop=\"loop\" poster=\"https://weston.ruter.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/view-transitions-poster.jpg\" src=\"https://weston.ruter.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/view-transitions-disabled-with-navigation-via-links.mp4\" width=\"756\"></video><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Without View Transitions</figcaption></figure>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-video aligncenter\"><video controls=\"controls\" height=\"1080\" loop=\"loop\" poster=\"https://weston.ruter.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/view-transitions-poster.jpg\" src=\"https://weston.ruter.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/view-transitions-enabled-with-navigation-via-links.mp4\" width=\"756\"></video><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">With View Transitions</figcaption></figure>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Note that these view transitions apply not only when navigating via links, but they also apply when navigating with the back/forward buttons in the browser:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns is-not-stacked-on-mobile is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-28f84493 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-video aligncenter\"><video controls=\"controls\" height=\"1080\" loop=\"loop\" poster=\"https://weston.ruter.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/view-transitions-via-bfcache-poster.jpg\" src=\"https://weston.ruter.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/view-transitions-disabled-with-navigation-via-bfcache.mp4\" width=\"722\"></video><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Without View Transitions</figcaption></figure>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-video aligncenter\"><video controls=\"controls\" height=\"1080\" loop=\"loop\" poster=\"https://weston.ruter.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/view-transitions-via-bfcache-poster.jpg\" src=\"https://weston.ruter.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/view-transitions-enabled-with-navigation-via-bfcache.mp4\" width=\"722\"></video><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">With View Transitions</figcaption></figure>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Nevertheless, as nice as these cross-document view transitions are, do note that there is no LCP improvement to using them. As referenced previously with Image Placeholders, the View Transitions plugin provides a non-performance user experience improvement. So don&#8217;t expect to find any difference in your Lighthouse scores or LCP passing rates with this plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Props again to <a href=\"https://felix-arntz.me/\">Felix Arntz</a> for spearheading this feature plugin.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\" style=\"height: 100px;\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"nocache-bfcache\">No-cache BFCache</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-wp-embed is-provider-plugin-directory wp-block-embed-plugin-directory\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\"><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/nocache-bfcache/\">No-cache BFCache</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Originally, the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/nocache-bfcache/\">No-cache BFCache</a> plugin was part of the “beyond” part of my talk because it wasn&#8217;t among the plugins featured by Performance Lab. However, this is no longer the case since <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/performance/releases/tag/2025-08-25\">v4.0.0</a>. In the previous section about Speculative Loading, I showed how prerendering enabled near instant page loads with practically zero LCP. But there is a much older browser technology for instantaneous page navigations: the <a href=\"https://web.dev/articles/bfcache\">back-forward cache</a> (bfcache). This was also depicted above in the back/forward navigation videos with view transitions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wrote up a <a href=\"https://weston.ruter.net/2025/07/23/instant-back-forward-navigations-in-wordpress/\">blog post</a> already all about bfcache and this plugin:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-wp-embed is-provider-weston-ruter wp-block-embed-weston-ruter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\"><a href=\"https://weston.ruter.net/2025/07/23/instant-back-forward-navigations-in-wordpress/\">Instant Back/Forward Navigations in WordPress</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To recap, webpages are generally not eligible for bfcache when they are served with <code>Cache-Control: no-store</code>. This header is sent when a user is logged-in and often on e-commerce sites for the shopping cart, checkout, and account pages. While it importantly prevents such pages from being cached by proxies, it also prevents the browser from storing pages in bfcache. This plugin removes the <code>no-store</code> directive. In its place, it ensures that the <code>private</code> directive is sent to prevent proxies from caching the response; also, to ensure preserve privacy after logging out, it includes logic to invalidate pages from the bfcache so they cannot be re-accessed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What follows is an example of a site running Twenty Twenty-Five with the BuddyPress plugin and Slow 4G network emulation. After entering an activity status update, I navigate from the Personal tab to the Mentions and Favorites tabs. Then I use the back button to go back to the Personal tab. Without bfcache, navigating back from the Favorites tab to the Personal tab is very slow since (1) the browser has to re-fetch the HTML from the server, and (2) the DOM has to be completely reconstructed. Without bfcache, there is also the unfortunate result that the drafted status update is lost, since the form field was re-constructed with JavaScript. In contrast, when bfcache is enabled, navigating to the previous tabs is instant, and the DOM is preserved with each navigation, resulting in the drafted status update being kept intact:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns is-not-stacked-on-mobile is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-28f84493 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-video aligncenter\"><video controls=\"controls\" height=\"1080\" poster=\"https://weston.ruter.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/buddypress-poster.jpg\" src=\"https://weston.ruter.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/buddypress-sans-bfcache.mp4\" width=\"788\"></video><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Without bfcache</figcaption></figure>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-video aligncenter\"><video controls=\"controls\" height=\"1080\" poster=\"https://weston.ruter.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/buddypress-poster.jpg\" src=\"https://weston.ruter.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/buddypress-with-bfcache.mp4\" width=\"788\"></video><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">With bfcache</figcaption></figure>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Without bfcache, the back navigation has an LCP of <strong>1.41 seconds</strong> whereas with bfcache the LCP is <strong>0.02 seconds</strong>: nearly instantaneous. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are other <a href=\"https://web.dev/articles/bfcache#optimize\">reasons</a> why pages may be ineligible for bfcache than the <code>no-store</code> directive, but it is one of the most common causes.

Consider a template with an Image block and a Navigation block, where the Image block has a lightbox and the Navigation block expands on mobile. These blocks use the Interactivity API which involves adding script modules to the page with the necessary logic. As noted previously, one of the key design principles of the Interactivity API is <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/interactivity-api/core-concepts/server-side-rendering/\">server-side rendering</a>. This means that by design the Navigation block and the Image block do <em>not</em> need their script modules in the critical rendering path.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It turns out that these script modules are currently loaded with high priority because the browser doesn&#8217;t know they aren&#8217;t critical. So they compete with the loading of critical resources, like the LCP image, even though script modules aren&#8217;t render blocking.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve written a <a href=\"https://weston.ruter.net/2025/05/26/improve-lcp-by-deprioritizing-interactivity-api-script-modules/\">separate post</a> all about this problem and the solution:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-wp-embed is-provider-weston-ruter wp-block-embed-weston-ruter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\"><a href=\"https://weston.ruter.net/2025/05/26/improve-lcp-by-deprioritizing-interactivity-api-script-modules/\">Improve LCP by Deprioritizing  Script Modules from the Interactivity API</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To summarize, there are two ways to prevent script modules from delaying the loading of critical resources:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Add <code>fetchpriority=​low</code> to the <code>SCRIPT</code> module tags and the <code>modulepreload</code> <code>LINK</code>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Move the <code>SCRIPT</code> tags to the end of the <code>BODY</code> (the footer).</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the results of these optimizations on an emulated broadband connection with an <code>IMG</code> as the LCP element:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table benchmark-web-vitals\"><table><thead><tr><th>Metric</th><th>Before</th><th>After</th><th>Diff (ms)</th><th>Diff (%)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>FCP</td><td>137.0</td><td>137.2</td><td>+0.2</td><td>+0.1%</td></tr><tr><td>LCP</td><td>406.0</td><td>368.8</td><td>-37.2</td><td><strong>-9.2%</strong></td></tr><tr><td>TTFB</td><td>33.7</td><td>33.6</td><td>-0.1</td><td>-0.1%</td></tr><tr><td>LCP-TTFB</td><td>371.7</td><td>336.0</td><td>-35.7</td><td>-9.6%</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a healthy LCP improvement, more impactful than using the Modern Image Formats with the AVIF format in my testing above. There are two plugins available on GitHub which implement these optimizations while waiting for them to be available in core:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/westonruter/script-fetchpriority-low\">Script Fetch Priority Low</a> (cf. <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/61734\" title=\"Add the ability to handle &quot;fetchpriority&quot; to ES Modules and Import Maps\">#61734</a>)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/westonruter/script-modules-in-footer\">Script Modules in Footer</a> (cf. <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/63486\" title=\"Script modules should support being printed in the footer the same as classic scripts\">#63486</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\" style=\"height: 100px;\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"minified-css-inlining\">Minified CSS Inlining</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The final optimization I&#8217;m analyzing is the impact of eliminating render-blocking external stylesheets. With JavaScript, adding <code>defer</code> to a <code>SCRIPT</code> is an easy way to prevent them from blocking rendering (assuming they can be deferred). However, this is not so easy to do with external stylesheets. CSS is always render-blocking because otherwise there is a flash of unstyled content (FOUC). The web platform does not (<a href=\"https://scottjehl.com/posts/async-css-already/\">currently</a>) provide an official way to opt in to <a href=\"https://www.filamentgroup.com/lab/load-css-simpler/\">async CSS</a>. Instead, the best way to handle this is to inline the CSS in <code>STYLE</code> tags (at least for the critical CSS).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On a vanilla WordPress install when loading the Sample Page, where the LCP element is text, there are two render-blocking stylesheets:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The Navigation block&#8217;s <code>style.min.css</code></li>\n\n\n\n<li>The Twenty Twenty-Five theme&#8217;s <code>style.css</code></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large wp-lightbox-container\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-36207 not-transparent\" height=\"243\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/weston.ruter.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/twentytwentyfive-render-blocking-stylesheets.png?resize=700%2C243&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"700\" /><button class=\"lightbox-trigger\" type=\"button\">\n			<svg fill=\"none\" height=\"12\" viewBox=\"0 0 12 12\" width=\"12\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n				<path d=\"M2 0a2 2 0 0 0-2 2v2h1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 1 .5-.5h2V0H2Zm2 10.5H2a.5.5 0 0 1-.5-.5V8H0v2a2 2 0 0 0 2 2h2v-1.5ZM8 12v-1.5h2a.5.5 0 0 0 .5-.5V8H12v2a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H8Zm2-12a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v2h-1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 0-.5-.5H8V0h2Z\" fill=\"#fff\">\n			</svg>\n		</button><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">External stylesheets in the DevTools network panel.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite these render-blocking stylesheets, Lighthouse is giving the page a 100 performance score. But as I&#8217;ve said before, just because you have a 100 score in Lighthouse, this doesn&#8217;t mean you can do more. Even with a perfect Lighthouse score, there is actually an audit that is pointing out the performance problem: <a href=\"https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/performance/render-blocking-resources\">Eliminate render-blocking resources</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large has-custom-border wp-lightbox-container\"><img alt=\"Eliminate render-blocking resources — Est savings of 0 ms.\n\nResources are blocking the first paint of your page. Consider delivering critical JS/CSS inline and deferring all non-critical JS/styles. Learn how to eliminate render-blocking resources.

This can be done as simply as follows:</p>\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><span><code class=\"hljs language-php\">add_action(\n	<span class=\"hljs-string\">\'wp_enqueue_scripts\'</span>,\n	<span class=\"hljs-function\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"hljs-params\">()</span>: <span class=\"hljs-title\">void</span> </span>{\n		wp_style_add_data(\n			<span class=\"hljs-string\">\'twentytwentyfive-style\'</span>,\n			<span class=\"hljs-string\">\'path\'</span>,\n			get_parent_theme_file_path( <span class=\"hljs-string\">\'style.css\'</span> )\n		);\n	},\n	<span class=\"hljs-number\">20</span>\n);</code></span></pre>\n\n\n<p>However, since the stylesheet is not yet minified (cf. <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/63012\" title=\"Bundled themes: Stylesheets should be minified\">#63012</a>), you can hack in runtime minification using a plugin like <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/westonruter/09e553a7b66d1a2e68cd5a9ed351c59b\">Twenty Twenty-Five Stylesheet Inlining</a>. This plugin is currently just in a Gist since I hope this will land soon in core for 6.9 via <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/63007\" title=\"Bundled themes: Stylesheets for block themes are missing path data for inlining\">#63007</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To increase the limit for inline CSS, all that is needed is a simple filter. The default limit is 20 KB which seems low considering the inline CSS limit for an AMP page is 75 KB. To increase the limit to 30 KB which allows enough room for the Navigation block&#8217;s relatively stylesheet to be inlined, you can use this PHP code:</p>\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><span><code class=\"hljs language-php\">add_filter(\n	<span class=\"hljs-string\">\'styles_inline_size_limit\'</span>,\n	<span class=\"hljs-function\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"hljs-params\">()</span>: <span class=\"hljs-title\">int</span> </span>{\n		<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">return</span> <span class=\"hljs-number\">30000</span>;\n	}\n);</code></span></pre>\n\n\n<details class=\"wp-block-details is-layout-flow wp-block-details-is-layout-flow\">Plugin used for benchmarking below<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><span><code class=\"hljs language-php\"><span class=\"hljs-meta\">&lt;?php</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-comment\">/**\n * Plugin Name: Increase Styles Inline Size Limit (styles_inline_size_limit)\n * Author: Weston Ruter\n * Update URI: false\n */</span>\nadd_filter(\n	<span class=\"hljs-string\">\'styles_inline_size_limit\'</span>,\n	<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">static</span> <span class=\"hljs-function\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"hljs-params\">()</span>: <span class=\"hljs-title\">int</span> </span>{\n		$limit = <span class=\"hljs-number\">-1</span>;\n		<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">if</span> ( <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">isset</span>( $_GET&#91;<span class=\"hljs-string\">\'styles_inline_size_limit\'</span>] ) ) {\n			$limit = (int) $_GET&#91;<span class=\"hljs-string\">\'styles_inline_size_limit\'</span>];\n		}\n		<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">if</span> ( $limit &lt; <span class=\"hljs-number\">0</span> ) {\n			$limit = <span class=\"hljs-number\">75000</span>;\n		}\n		<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">return</span> $limit;\n	}\n);</code></span></pre></details>\n\n\n\n<p>Increasing this limit in core is being tracked in <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/63018\" title=\"Increase styles_inline_size_limit from 20,000 bytes\">#63018</a>.

I was a student working on a simple project, a portfolio website. I wanted to use WordPress because it felt easy to learn and flexible enough to build what I had in mind. I completed the project and proudly showed it to my teacher.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of encouragement, I was told to scrap it. “Do it with raw PHP coding,” my teacher said. WordPress was dismissed as the easy way out. At the time, that felt discouraging. I followed instructions and rewrote everything in PHP, but the memory stayed with me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What my teacher could not see was what I had already discovered. WordPress had opened a door. It gave me confidence that I could build something meaningful with the skills I had. That moment became a seed. It was the beginning of a path that would later shape my career, my community work, and my life.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-learn\">Learn</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2016, I joined weDevs. This was my first real step into the professional WordPress ecosystem. Products like <strong>Dokan</strong> and <strong>WP User Frontend</strong> were not just plugins. They were solutions that empowered people. Dokan made it possible for anyone to create a multi-vendor marketplace without needing deep technical knowledge. WP User Frontend gave site owners control from the frontend in a way that felt natural and accessible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then came <strong>WP ERP</strong>. This plugin fascinated me more than anything else at that time. The idea that WordPress could run HR, CRM, and accounting for a business was almost unbelievable. For me, it was proof that WordPress is like water. It can take any form. It can flow into any gap and solve almost any problem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Later, I worked with newer products, including <strong>ElementsKit</strong>, MetForm, ShopEngine, GetGenie AI, which now powers more than <strong>2 million websites</strong> around the world<strong>.</strong> Over the years, I built an <strong>8-year career in WordPress product marketing</strong>, working with multiple global companies to grow their eCommerce, LMS, SaaS, and WordPress products.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But my learning did not stop there. Coming from a computer science background, I shifted into marketing. At first, I wasn’t sure I belonged in this space. But I discovered that having the knowledge of algorithms, logic, and technical systems helped me become a better marketer. It allowed me to solve business problems more effectively and to connect with product teams in a way that bridged technical and user needs. That blend of skills became my advantage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As Shakespeare wrote, <em>“To be or not to be, that is the question.”</em> For me, the answer has always been to be—to be curious, to be adaptable, and to be willing to learn. Or in the words of Bruce Lee, <em>“Be water, my friend.”</em> That is what WordPress has taught me. Adapt, flow, and find your form.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-connect\">Connect</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2017, I organized my first WordPress meetup. It was a small gathering, but the energy in the room was undeniable. People came together to share, to teach, to learn, and to encourage each other. That was when I saw the true strength of WordPress. It was not just software. It was a community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From that point on, I made community a core part of my life. Meetups turned into WordCamps. I spoke at events. I volunteered wherever I could. And I attended as many gatherings as possible. To date, I have been part of <strong>25 WordCamps around the world.</strong> Each one gave me new lessons, friendships, and a sense of belonging.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first time I spoke at WordCamp Kathmandu 2019, I was nervous. I had fixed what I would say but my heart was racing. I kept thinking, <em>“What if nobody listens? What if I fail?”</em> When I walked onto the stage and looked at the audience, something changed. I saw faces eager to learn. I realized they were not there to judge me. They were there to grow with me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was a panel discussion where I sat together with my mentor, <strong>M Asif Rahman</strong>, and we discussed marketing WordPress products. That panel discussion gave me confidence I had never felt before. It showed me that sharing what you know, even if it feels small, can inspire others. After that, I participated in two other panel discussions: <strong>WordCamp Nagpur in 2022</strong> and <strong>WordCamp Sylhet in 2024.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the years, I have served as a WordCamp Organizer, Speaker, Volunteer, Global Mentor, and Event Supporter. I mentored teams as they organized their first WordCamps, helping them overcome challenges and celebrate success. These connections showed me that WordPress is not just a platform to build websites. It is a platform to build people. It gives us the tools, but more importantly, it gives us the relationships that carry us forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2022, I was humbled to receive the <strong>Yoast Care Fund award</strong> for my community contributions. It reminded me that the efforts we give to the community, often behind the scenes, do not go unnoticed.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-contribute\">Contribute</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With learning and connection came responsibility. I knew I had to contribute.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Contribution takes many forms. For me, it has been about building communities, mentoring, and supporting events. I have served as a WordCamp Mentor and Global Event Supporter, helping new organizers take their first steps. I have guided teams, answered their questions, and encouraged them through the challenges of organizing. Seeing them succeed gave me joy that no personal achievement could replace.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordCamp Asia holds a special place in my heart. I have been part of its organizing team three times so far, including working with the AX and communications teams. It was a chance to tell stories, welcome attendees, and celebrate the diversity of Asia’s WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I joined the organizing team for the first WordCamp Asia in 2022, it felt like stepping into history. This was the first flagship WordCamp in our region, and expectations were sky high. I worked on the AX team, helping to provide an amazing experience to the attendees. There were long nights, endless discussions, and moments of uncertainty. But when the doors opened and thousands of people gathered, it was worth it. That event showed me how powerful Asia’s WordPress community had become. It was proof that our voices, our energy, and our contributions mattered on a global scale.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since then, I continued serving as part of <strong>WordCamp Asia 2023 and 2025</strong>, and later joined the <strong>organizing team of WordCamp US 2025</strong>, one of the biggest WordPress events in the world. Being part of that team was a reminder that no matter where we come from, our contributions connect us on a global scale.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2025, I was also honoured to be selected as a recipient of the <strong>Automattic Open Horizons Scholarship</strong>, which supports contributors from underrepresented communities in continuing their WordPress journey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same time, I am pursuing a <strong>PhD in marketing</strong>, researching Agile Marketing Methodologies for Promoting Digital Software Products. For me, this connects directly to WordPress. Agile and AI-driven methods are shaping how we market plugins, SaaS platforms, and digital tools. My research helps me give back not only to academia but also to the WordPress ecosystem by exploring new ways to reach people, improve adoption, and create sustainable growth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Volunteering, speaking, organizing, mentoring, researching — each role has shown me the same truth. Contribution is not about doing everything. It is about showing up, sharing what you can, and making space for others to shine.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-a-story-for-marketers-who-wonder-can-i-belong\">A Story for Marketers Who Wonder: “Can I Belong?”</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are a marketer, a writer, or someone who feels more comfortable with words than code, you may wonder if you truly belong in WordPress. I want to speak directly to you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>You do belong.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress needs your thinking. It needs your storytelling. It needs people who can bridge the gap between product and user. Your technical background, even if it is small, is an asset. Your creativity is essential. Your ability to connect with people is what gives technology meaning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I moved from computer science into marketing and found my place. You can too. You don’t have to be a developer to be valuable. Contribution comes in many forms. Learning, connecting, mentoring, writing, organizing—all of these matter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember: <strong>WordPress is like water.</strong> It adapts to the needs of its people. And in the same way, you can adapt your own path in it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-lessons\">Lessons</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking back, three words define my WordPress journey.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Learn.</strong> WordPress taught me more than software. It taught me resilience, curiosity, and the courage to explore.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Connect.</strong> The relationships I built through meetups, WordCamps, mentoring, and organizing have been the most valuable part of this journey.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Contribute.</strong> Giving back to the community has been my way of honouring everything I have received.<br /></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-wrapping-up\">Wrapping Up</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I sometimes think about that moment in my classroom when my teacher told me not to use WordPress. At the time, it felt like rejection. Today, I see it as the spark that lit the way forward. Without that moment, perhaps I would not have discovered what WordPress truly means to me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress has been my teacher, my platform, and my community. It has given me a career, friendships across the world, and a purpose that goes beyond myself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am also a loving father of a 3-year-old daughter and a proud husband. My family gives me balance and joy, and they remind me why community and contribution matter so much.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are reading this and wondering whether you belong in WordPress, I want you to know that you do. Whether you are a developer, a writer, a designer, or someone still figuring out your path, there is space for you here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Start by learning. Reach out and connect. Then, when you are ready, contribute in your own way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That is how WordPress grows. That is how communities grow. And that is how we grow as people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Learn. Connect.

কিন্তু মঞ্চে উঠে দেখলাম সবাই শিখতে এসেছে। তখনই সাহস পেলাম।</p>\n\n\n\n<p>২০২২ সালে কমিউনিটিতে অবদানের জন্য আমি <strong>Yoast Care Fund Award</strong> পেয়েছিলাম।</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-অবদ-ন-র-খ-ন\">অবদান রাখুন</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>শেখা আর সংযোগের পর বুঝলাম ফিরিয়ে দেওয়ার সময় এসেছে।</p>\n\n\n\n<p>আমি কাজ করেছি <strong>WordCamp Mentor</strong> আর <strong>Global Event Supporter</strong> হিসেবে। নতুন আয়োজকদের পাশে দাঁড়িয়েছি, তাদের সাহায্য করেছি। তাদের সাফল্য আমাকে সবসময় খুশি করেছে।</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>WordCamp Asia</strong> আমার কাছে খুবই বিশেষ। আমি ২০২২, ২০২৩ আর ২০২৫ এ আয়োজক টিমে ছিলাম। পরে যুক্ত হই <strong>WordCamp US 2025</strong> এর টিমেও।</p>\n\n\n\n<p>২০২৫ সালে আমি পাই <strong>Automattic Open Horizons Scholarship</strong>। একই সময়ে মার্কেটিং এ পিএইচডি করছি, যেখানে গবেষণা করছি কিভাবে নতুন পদ্ধতিতে সফটওয়্যার প্রোডাক্ট প্রচার করা যায়।</p>\n\n\n\n<p>এসব অভিজ্ঞতা আমাকে শিখিয়েছে: অবদান মানে সবকিছু করতে হবে না, বরং যা পারেন সেটুকু নিয়মিত শেয়ার করাটাই আসল।</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-ম-র-ক-ট-রদ-র-জন-য-কথ\">মার্কেটারদের জন্য কথা</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>আপনি যদি মার্কেটার হন, লেখক হন বা কোডের চেয়ে লেখালেখি ভালো পারেন, তবে নিশ্চিন্ত থাকুন, ওয়ার্ডপ্রেসে আপনার জায়গা আছে।</p>\n\n\n\n<p>ওয়ার্ডপ্রেস শুধু ডেভেলপারদের প্রয়োজন নেই। প্রোডাক্ট আর ব্যবহারকারীর মধ্যে সেতু গড়তে যারা পারে, গল্প বলতে পারে, মানুষের সাথে সংযোগ তৈরি করতে পারে, তাদেরও সমানভাবে দরকার।</p>\n\n\n\n<p>আমি কম্পিউটার সায়েন্স থেকে মার্কেটিং এ এসেছি, আপনিও পারবেন নিজের জায়গা খুঁজে নিতে। শেখা, লেখা, আয়োজন, মেন্টরিং সবই অবদান।</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-শ-ক-ষ\">শিক্ষা</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>আমার যাত্রাকে তিনটি শব্দ সবচেয়ে ভালোভাবে বোঝায় &#8211;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>শিখুন.</strong> কৌতূহলী হোন, শিখুন, এগিয়ে যান।</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>যুক্ত হোন.</strong> সম্পর্ক আর বন্ধুত্বই আসল শক্তি।</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>অবদান রাখুন.</strong> যা শিখেছেন, সেটা অন্যদের সাথে ভাগ করুন।</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-শ-ষ-কথ\">শেষ কথা</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>শুরুতে শিক্ষক আমাকে ওয়ার্ডপ্রেসে কাজ করতে মানা করেছিলেন। তখন খারাপ লেগেছিল, কিন্তু আজ বুঝি সেটাই আমাকে সামনে এগিয়ে নিয়ে গেছে।</p>\n\n\n\n<p>ওয়ার্ডপ্রেস আমার শিক্ষক, আমার প্ল্যাটফর্ম, আমার কমিউনিটি। এখান থেকেই আমি ক্যারিয়ার, বন্ধু আর জীবনের উদ্দেশ্য খুঁজে পেয়েছি।</p>\n\n\n\n<p>আমি একজন ৩ বছরের মেয়ের বাবা আর একজন গর্বিত স্বামী। পরিবারই আমাকে সব সময় প্রেরণা আর আনন্দ দেয়।</p>\n\n\n\n<p>আপনি ডেভেলপার হোন, লেখক হোন বা এখনও নিজের পথ খুঁজছেন, ওয়ার্ডপ্রেসে আপনার জন্য জায়গা আছে। শুরু করুন শেখা দিয়ে, তারপর সংযোগ তৈরি করুন আর ধীরে ধীরে অবদান রাখুন।</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>শিখুন. যুক্ত হোন. অবদান রাখুন. এটাই আমার গল্প।</strong></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/learn-connect-contribute-my-wordpress-story/\">Learn.

Baby steps. In any case, Core Web Vitals Assessment: Passed <img alt=\"✅\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"https://weston.ruter.net/wp-content/plugins/local-twemoji/images/emoji/72x72/2705.png?ver=16-0-1\" style=\"height: 1em;\" /></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Yesterday, I checked <a href=\"https://pagespeed.web.dev/\">PageSpeed Insights</a> again, and I was excited to discover that my blog is now also appearing in field metrics for mobile as well! And like desktop, the CWV assessment is also passing for mobile. The <a href=\"https://developer.chrome.com/docs/crux#:~:text=primarily%20that%20they%20must%20be%20publicly%20discoverable%20and%20there%20must%20be%20a%20large%20enough%20number%20of%20visitors%20in%20order%20to%20create%20a%20statistically%20significant%20dataset\">eligibility criteria</a> for the CrUX dataset includes that “there must be a large enough number of visitors in order to create a statistically significant dataset.” Granted, my site is still only getting enough traffic for origin-level metrics, and I can&#8217;t see field metrics for the homepage URL specifically, but it&#8217;s another baby step! (Or maybe a toddler step?)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve really been trying to double down this summer on tuning every bit of performance possible out of WordPress (on the frontend), using my site as a case study, and I&#8217;ve been sharing my findings in posts here. I hope the site traffic is an indication that the community has found my posts helpful. The learnings are also making their way into <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/performance-lab/\">Performance Lab</a> feature plugins as well as in performance improvements on the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2025/07/28/roadmap-to-6-9/#performance-improvements\">roadmap for WordPress 6.9</a>. I have some more posts that I&#8217;m working on. You can <a href=\"https://weston.ruter.net/subscribe/\">subscribe</a> to get them in your inbox.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On August 27th (next Wednesday) at <a href=\"https://us.wordcamp.org/2025/\">WordCamp US 2025</a> here in Portland, Oregon, I&#8217;m giving a talk called “<a href=\"https://us.wordcamp.org/2025/session/the-site-speed-frontier-with-performance-lab-and-beyond/\"><strong>The Site Speed Frontier with Performance Lab and Beyond</strong></a>” at <time datetime=\"2025-08-21T11:30:00-07:00\">11:30am PDT</time>. I hope to see you there, but it will also be livestreamed and recorded. I&#8217;ll be blogging an elaborated version of what I have time to share in my talk. (By the way, if you are attending in person, check out <a href=\"https://weston.ruter.net/2024/09/12/my-portland-picks/\">My Portland Picks</a> post for what I recommend visitors check out!)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One takeaway I&#8217;ll be emphasizing in my talk is that we needn&#8217;t settle with sites merely <em>passing</em> the Core Web Vitals assessment or achieving a “perfect” 100 performance score in Lighthouse. Why be content with a good 2-second <abbr title=\"Largest Contentful Paint\">LCP</abbr> when it could be half that or even practically zero? Web performance is a journey, and there&#8217;s always room for improvement. I can see from my blog&#8217;s field metrics, for example, that the <abbr title=\"Time To First Byte\">TTFB</abbr> is hovering around the threshold between “needs improvement” and “poor”. In spite of this, the frontend is so tuned that on mobile the <abbr title=\"LCP minus/discounting the TTFB\">LCP-TTFB</abbr> in CrUX is  400ms and on desktop it&#8217;s only 100ms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I personally love optimizing the performance of WordPress sites, but I get it that this isn&#8217;t for everyone (nor should it be). By landing our improvements from the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/performance/handbook/about-the-team/\">Core Performance Team</a>, my hope is that WordPress core (and the ecosystem) will have best practices implemented by default so that site owners needn&#8217;t worry about performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p>I had to take some <abbr title=\"PageSpeed Insights\">PSI</abbr> screenshots to memorialize the milestone:</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-center\">Field Data via CrUX</h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns alignwide is-not-stacked-on-mobile is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-28f84493 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full wp-lightbox-container\"><img alt=\"Core Web Vitals Assessment for Mobile: Passed.

My name is Nathan Wrigley.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jukebox is a podcast which is dedicated to all things WordPress. The people, the events, the plugins, the blocks, the themes, and in this case the long complex story of how WordPress came to have a.com and.org variety.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to subscribe to the podcast, you can do that by searching for WP Tavern in your podcast player of choice, or by going to wptavern.com/feed/podcast, and you can copy and paste that URL into most podcast players.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a topic that you&#8217;d like us to feature on the podcast, I&#8217;m keen to hear from you and hopefully get you, or your idea, featured on the show. Head to wptavern.com/contact/jukebox, and use the form there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So on the podcast today, we have Michelle Frechette and Jonathan Desrosiers. Michelle is well known in the WordPress community for her myriad roles, including Executive Director of Post Status, and program director for WP Includes. She&#8217;s a prolific freelancer, podcaster, and a driving force behind many WordPress initiatives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jonathan is a WordPress Core committer, contributing to the project since 2013, and has been sponsored by Bluehost to work on WordPress Core since 2018. His work largely takes place behind the scenes supporting contributors, maintaining build tools, and keeping WordPress running smoothly for millions of users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;ve ever searched for WordPress online, you&#8217;ve probably found both wordpress.com and wordpress.org at the top of your results, and like many, you might be unsure what really separates the two.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, Michelle and Jonathan helped clear up the history, philosophy, and practical differences between wordpress.com and wordpress.org.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They talk about how these two flavors of WordPress came to be, why they&#8217;ve both been key to WordPress&#8217;s growth and the ways they overlap and differ in features, user experience, and monetization.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle shares her perspectives as a longtime user and advocate, with experience across both.com and.org sites. While Jonathan dives into the technical and historical details from his Core contributor vantage point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They also explore whether the naming conventions of .com and.org have helped or hindered the project, and how the WordPress communities open source ethos shapes the ongoing conversation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Along the way, they touch on how .com made WordPress accessible in the early days, the importance of data portability, and evolving efforts to unify the user experience between the two platforms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;ve ever wondered which version of WordPress is right for you, why the projects seems split into two variants, or how community and commerce intertwine in the WordPress ecosystem, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in finding out more, you can find all of the links in the show notes by heading to wptavern.com/podcast, where you&#8217;ll find all the other episodes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so without further delay, I bring you Michelle Frechette and Jonathan Desrosiers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am joined on the podcast by two guests today. I&#8217;m joined by Michelle Frechette and Jonathan Desrosiers. Hello.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:48] <strong>Michelle Frechette:</strong> Hello.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:48] <strong>Jonathan Desrosiers:</strong> Hi, how&#8217;s it going?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:49] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, good thank you. We&#8217;re going to talk today a little bit about a subject, which I confess confuses me greatly. It&#8217;s the differences, the similarities between WordPresses variance, .com and.org.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before we get into that, I know it&#8217;s a terribly generic thing to do, but nevertheless, we&#8217;re going to do it anyway because we have a new audience member each time this podcast airs. So I&#8217;m going to ask you both to give us your little potted bio. Tell us who you are. So let&#8217;s start with Michelle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:14] <strong>Michelle Frechette:</strong> Hi, I am Michelle Frechette. I do a lot of freelancing type work in WordPress, and I also am the Executive Director of Post Status, and the Program Director for WP Includes. I have a couple podcasts, a couple different things that I do, lots of different projects I&#8217;ve started, none of which are relevant today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:31] <strong>Jonathan Desrosiers:</strong> Hi, I am Jonathan Desrosiers. I am a WordPress Core committer since 2018. I&#8217;ve been contributing to the project in some way since 2013, and I am partially sponsored by Bluehost to be a contributor to the project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so for me, a lot of that results in, some people call it invisible work, but I&#8217;m behind the scenes just making sure people are supported properly, they have the resources they need, they&#8217;re not blocked.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also do a lot with our build tools. So making sure our tests keep running and our different build processes to build the software that&#8217;s eventually shipped to the world is working in order. Yeah, you&#8217;ll find me a little bit everywhere. I&#8217;m a generalist. I have my hands in a lot of different things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:13] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Well, thank you both for joining me and also for giving us your credentials there. That&#8217;s great. So we&#8217;re going to get into this strange topic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, I just carried out a typical search. I went onto a search engine. It wasn&#8217;t Google, by the way, but nevertheless, I went to a search engine, and I typed in one word, and that word was WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;m now confronted by a result at the top, which says wordpress.com. That came in at number one. The second result for me was wordpress.org. And I&#8217;ll just give you the headlines. It says wordpress.com, this is the first result, wordpress.com, everything you need to build your website. And then the second result, download wordpress.org.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And both of you know the difference. I know the difference, on a very high level, I understand the difference, but when we get into the weeds, I quickly start to misunderstand what the difference is. But they are different. These two things are radically different in their intention, in the relationship they have with their users, the way that they&#8217;re monetised, and so on and so forth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So let&#8217;s, first of all, just clear that up. Let&#8217;s rewind the clock, if you like. How did this all start? What&#8217;s the history of wordpress.com and wordpress.org. And then we can get into what the heck they are and how they&#8217;re different a bit later. So, I don&#8217;t know who wants to answer that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:28] <strong>Michelle Frechette:</strong> I&#8217;ll give a quick start. Then I&#8217;m going to let Jonathan get into the more technical aspects of things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Back in the nineties, blogging became a thing, and lots of people were establishing blogs online through things like Blogger, Blogspot and all those things. And then WordPress was one of the blogging platforms that you could create your blog on. All of them were free. I think I still have a Blogspot out there somewhere with really angsty poetry on it. So if you ever really want to find that out, sure, I could send you a link. But the idea was that, you know, you could get online and you could do the blogging things with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then it was like, well, is it just for blogging or could it be used for other things? And so there are still people today that when you say, oh, I could build you a WordPress website, say, isn&#8217;t that just a blog? And to which I say, look at all of these websites that are built on, like the White House and NASA and all of these other things that are not just blogging, and are building their websites on WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that&#8217;s different necessarily from wordpress.com where I do have a blog, right? I actually, it&#8217;s actually a website, wptrailbuddies.wordpress.com. I&#8217;m using the free .com to create a very quick, very simple, very easy way for people to sign up for one program.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I also have several websites built on the .org idea, right, which is self-hosted. Find a host, download the software, or have the one button install, which is much more common now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then also I have a paid plan on wordpress.com as well, which takes away any ad space, and also allows me to have plugins and themes within that website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s what I know at the surface level, what are the differences. I know that Jonathan knows much more about the software itself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:13] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, I think you&#8217;ve highlighted some of the top level items, so we&#8217;ll circle back to those in a moment. But first, let&#8217;s get Jonathan&#8217;s take on that. So it&#8217;s the history question, really. What&#8217;s the history of these two different things?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:24] <strong>Jonathan Desrosiers:</strong> Yeah, so WordPress started as a project in 2003, and it&#8217;s what we call a fork. And so you probably know if you listen to this, that WordPress is open source software. And basically that means, it&#8217;s licensed under the GPL, and you have the right to download it, make modifications, see how it works. We distribute, all those things are your right to do with the software that is published.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so it was forked from a project called b2 where a couple people were not really happy with the development that was happening on that, bugs weren&#8217;t being fixed to their liking, and so they decided to fork it. And so that was Matt Mullenweg and Mike Little. And that was in 2003, and they called it WordPress. And so that was the beginning of the WordPress project that we know today that is now over 22 years old.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few years later, Automattic just turned 20 years old, so in 2005, Matt Mullenweg, one of the co-creators of WordPress, co-founders of WordPress, decided to create a company. And so he created a company called Automattic. And the company&#8217;s bread and butter was obviously WordPress, because he knew it very well. And so that&#8217;s how wordpress.com came about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And in many ways it was the first true managed WordPress hosting platform, because you could sign up, you could get a blog for free, and you still can, and your URL will be, you know, nathanssite.wordpress.com, or johnssite.wordpress.com. And you can pay for additional things such as, the subscription plans allow you to have a custom domain name, and that&#8217;s evolved. The features that you can pay for has evolved significantly over the years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But along with this is the WordPress software that I mentioned earlier. And so the WordPress software is available for anyone to download and run, as I mentioned. And Automattic has a hosting setup that runs the open source software. And so many of the hosts that you have today, you all run that same software at the core of it, and it&#8217;s just a matter of what services are surrounded with it. What do they allow you to do within their environment? And how they support you in your journey to have an online presence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:36] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So the .com side of things was a very early move. So really, more or less as, I mean we&#8217;re into sort of the 20 plus years of history of WordPress, but right back near the beginning it was made easier to install. And nowadays, if you go to more or less any host that&#8217;s got any association with WordPress, they will offer some kind of one click solution, which makes it trivially easy, within a couple of moments, really, and a few buttons, you&#8217;ll have a version of WordPress. And I&#8217;m talking there about the .org side of things. So you&#8217;ll have a .org install of WordPress. Really straightforward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, if you rewind the clock right back to the beginning when .com started, I&#8217;m guessing it was a much more painful process. There weren&#8217;t these managed hosts where you could do that, and so it made sense, I guess, into the market to put something where you didn&#8217;t need to install anything. You simply sign up, create an account, be it free or paid, we&#8217;ll get into that in a moment as well, and you&#8217;ve got yourself the software.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I guess that&#8217;s an important part to remember. It was much more difficult back then to do the .org thing than it is now. So many tools now making it relatively straightforward. I guess that&#8217;s a part of the success of .com, that it was just the first mover made it more straightforward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:51] <strong>Jonathan Desrosiers:</strong> The WordPress project has several philosophies that we use to guide our decisions and how we choose what makes it into the software and what shape that takes. And some of those, for example, are design for the majority, decisions not options, clean, lean, and mean, striving for simplicity, out of the box software.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so you see this in the setup process in the five minute install. We really aim to make the installation as simple as possible for the software itself. But that doesn&#8217;t mean the surrounding database set up and server set up and uploading, getting the files on the server, doesn&#8217;t mean that that&#8217;s easy as a part of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so WordPress could be two clicks to install. Could be really simple, email and password and installs it for you, but it doesn&#8217;t really, can only contribute so much to that cohesive experience, that all encompassing experience of what a website is, of what hosting is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:42] <strong>Michelle Frechette:</strong> I think back to, again, the early days of blogging where that was the goal. You could change the colors behind it, you were limited to the theming that was provided with whatever platform you were choosing from. And the way that we&#8217;ve grown from just like, here are your five options, kind of like a MySpace idea, right? You&#8217;re kind of limited with what you could do back in those days as well, to where you can do a lot more now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so even with .com, with the free plan, you have a lot more options than you did 20 years ago, 23 years ago. And if you upgrade to a business plan, then you have all the options basically that you have with the install, the .org install for yourself, self-hosted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the things I love about it is that I don&#8217;t have to worry about security, I don&#8217;t have to worry about traffic, and I don&#8217;t have to worry about upgrades. I don&#8217;t get a message that my PHP version is outdated. On some other sites where I&#8217;m self-hosting, I have to make sure that everything&#8217;s up to date all the time. With the .com. It&#8217;s one of those things that I don&#8217;t have to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so for me, that is one of the benefits. Of course, I have only one site there, but I&#8217;m loving the fact I can walk away from it and not be having to check it on a regular basis. And I think that&#8217;s one of the beautiful things for people who are not tech savvy, because they can get in and do the things like they would in one of the competitors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:57] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So a lot of this conversation is going to be done through the prism of history, you know, and decisions that were made which now perhaps people have got opinions about, maybe they think poor decisions were made, or brilliant decisions were made, they were made at a different time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;m going to allude to what I said right at the top of this episode, which was that if you do a Google search, for just simply for the word WordPress, and that probably is the word that you&#8217;ve heard. You probably have no familiarity with whatever WordPress is. You just, somebody told you, you know, you were in a bar somewhere and somebody said, oh, you want a website? WordPress can do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you end up at a search engine and in it goes, WordPress, and up come these slightly conflicting things. And I guess that&#8217;s maybe where some problems for end users begin. We&#8217;re in the inside of it all, so we&#8217;ve totally got a grip on this. We might not understand the intricacies of all of the bits and pieces, but we understand what .com is and we understand the difference.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a question you don&#8217;t have to answer in a binary way. It doesn&#8217;t have to be a yes or a no. But, do you think with the benefit of hindsight, it would&#8217;ve been a good idea to call these different versions different things? So for example, WordPress could have been the .com or the .org, and it would&#8217;ve had a different name for something else. And that&#8217;s purely from a, keeping it obvious what the two different things are. So again, you can obfuscate or you know, dodge that question if you like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:18] <strong>Michelle Frechette:</strong> I&#8217;m reminded of George Foreman, whose children are all named George.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:23] <strong>Jonathan Desrosiers:</strong> Most confusing household ever. Without getting into the nuances of the agreements and all, how the permissions work, Automattic just has special permission to use the WordPress trademark. And so that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s called wordpress.com and wordpress.org. And while there are some, there is some confusion that comes from that. In many ways, it also has contributed to the success of the project, because in the early days, it was very easy to get a site spun up on WordPress, on wordpress.com, and people started using WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so there are definitely people out there that solely started using WordPress because they got to wordpress.com and they were able to get a site. And now more and more hosting companies are much more capable, and we all have our own, like I said, I work at Bluehost, so for example, we have our own special sauce of onboarding, where we ask you a couple questions and we help you. We find that the thing people struggle with a lot is where to start.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You get dumped into WordPress, right? And you don&#8217;t know where to start. What do I need on my site? What do I make it look like? What do I need to do? And so using these onboarding questions to produce a starting point for you, that&#8217;s contextual to what you&#8217;re trying to do. And so that&#8217;s one of the things that we take pride in is our onboarding process that we&#8217;re working on and is available if you want to try it out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But all that to say is that, you know, in the early days it was definitely a benefit. And now as the project has grown to over 40% of the internet, that confusion gets magnified in some ways. And a lot of times that takes the form of, as you said, Googling and finding conflicting resources as people not accurately describing the differences.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We get a lot of tickets on Trac, which is the bug tracking software for WordPress, for the software itself, that incorrectly is saying there&#8217;s a bug, but it&#8217;s actually intended behavior, but it&#8217;s on .com and not in the .org software. The support forums are full of people that are not sure of the difference.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so it&#8217;s just important as community members that we keep this in mind, that it&#8217;s not always easy to understand, but a lot of times people just need a push in the right direction. And in some ways it returns to our philosophies of making it simple because the majority of WordPress users are not technically minded and so they probably don&#8217;t care about the difference, right? They just want their WordPress site. I have a site, I need it up, I need it to not go down. I need customers. And so keeping that lens in mind as well is helpful to get through this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:40] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It is kind of interesting, I&#8217;ve been using the internet more or less from the beginning and although these boundaries have got really blurred, back in the day, anything which ended .org had a real kind of community, charity, non-profit kind of focus to it. I don&#8217;t know if you both remember that as well, but anything ended .org, it felt like there was a philanthropic purpose to it. And anything which was .com, that wasn&#8217;t the case.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:11] <strong>Michelle Frechette:</strong> It was commerce.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:12] <strong>Jonathan Desrosiers:</strong> Commercial. Yeah, it for commercial.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:13] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, there go. So commercial, company, along those lines. And I don&#8217;t know when that was, but that just ceased to be a thing at some point. But back when .com began, naming it .org maybe was a bigger signpost than it now appears to be, if you know what I mean. Oh, look, it&#8217;s WordPress, it&#8217;s .org. It speaks for itself. It&#8217;s a philanthropic version or what have you. And that is maybe a part of the jigsaw puzzle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And again, rewinding history, when the split happened between.com and .org, I&#8217;m presuming that nobody had any intuition that any of this was going to be successful in any way, shape, or form. .com, you know, the commercial wing could have been an absolute failure. The whole project could have collapsed within a couple of years. . org, again, nobody took any interest in it. It just didn&#8217;t work out. And it became, well, another b2, the annals of history. And it didn&#8217;t work out that way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I guess once you&#8217;ve started down the path, you are going to stick with it. There would be no point 3 years in in saying, you know what? Everybody&#8217;s confused about .com, .org, we should upend the whole thing. I guess that&#8217;s off the table a bit at that point as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:20] <strong>Michelle Frechette:</strong> Well, I think that the generic web user who&#8217;s not a techie still doesn&#8217;t necessarily have an idea that the .org and .com were originally intended for different audiences, right? So I think that, I mean there are, definitely are some savvy people who understand that, but I think that the majority of people still, it doesn&#8217;t matter if it&#8217;s a .io, we have so many extensions now that I think it&#8217;s kind of blurred what those actually mean. And if you actually go to register a .org, it&#8217;ll say, do you want the .com and the dot net, and the dot whatever else too? So that you&#8217;re kind of getting all of your traffic driven to the same place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that that is something that, yes, we understand that now. And I think that we would&#8217;ve always understood that, the three of us, but I don&#8217;t know that that was such a huge distinction back in the day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also think that it was one of those things where, you know, you have light versions of something or, you know, you have free versions of other things in life that aren&#8217;t software related that you can upgrade to or that, you know, free gifts with purchase.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I think the idea of, you could have this free one, or you can upgrade to these other things, or you could take it and run with it and do it your own thing, I think is something that made sense at the beginning, but again, can be slightly confusing now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because I do see people come to my meetup and they&#8217;re asking questions, and we all try to troubleshoot. We get them to log in, and we&#8217;re like, oh, okay, now I see, you&#8217;re using the free version, so you don&#8217;t have the ability to add this plugin or change your theme this way, or use CSS, you know, and those kinds of things, as you can with the paid version or with the self-hosted. And so I think that there is an opportunity for us to make that distinction in different places.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I will say one of the benefits, however, even if you start on the free .com, you can upgrade to paid and get that, or you can port that over to your own self-hosted as well. Other competitors don&#8217;t necessarily let you, like take your whole version of your website that you&#8217;ve built on their platform and bring it into a self-hosted situation like WordPress can.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so even if you made the decision to go with wordpress.com, and halfway through a build, or a year later, realise that you really wish you had done something different, we make it easy for you to be able to take that and move it someplace else, like Bluehost or you know, SiteGround or other places like that. So we make it easy for you. We&#8217;re not trying to shove you into one box and make you stay there and say look at all those people over there doing things you wish you could do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:43] <strong>Jonathan Desrosiers:</strong> Yeah, I think that the underlying motivations was just fueled by the open source ideals, and the software belongs to the people and not so much specific companies or corporations. And so by putting it in .org, it was just more about being open and available and for the community, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matt and Mike, when they forked b2, the intention was to get more people to work on it with them, right? And ensure that the software that they were running their website with survived and continued to grow and didn&#8217;t have bugs. And so I think that that was just part of the motivation where, I just looked it up, and the .org domains were intended to only be used by organisations. And it seems like the intention was to require documentation at some point, but it was never enforced.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, when I got, in the late two thousands when I got involved, there was always the perception in my mind that you had to be an organisation to get one of those right? But that&#8217;s not actually the case. At least my early perception was that I needed it in order to do that. And so I wonder if that persists with other people as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I think that what Michelle also said resonates well is that, you know, no matter where you WordPress, you&#8217;re going to be able to take your site with you and go somewhere else. And that&#8217;s what makes WordPress great. And maybe you&#8217;re not even taking your site somewhere else, maybe you&#8217;re just taking out your content and, I don&#8217;t know, maybe feeding it into AI, or creating a book of all your posts, like a historical reference or something.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:07] <strong>Michelle Frechette:</strong> I did that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:07] <strong>Jonathan Desrosiers:</strong> That sounds kind of cool actually, yeah. And so being able to take your content with you and you are the true owner of your content, and you have the rights to it, is not something that&#8217;s true for other platforms. You know, not to name names, but there&#8217;s a lot of other website platforms where it&#8217;s difficult to impossible to extract out your content if you need to move somewhere else.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:27] <strong>Michelle Frechette:</strong> It&#8217;s a lot of copy, paste at that point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:29] <strong>Jonathan Desrosiers:</strong> Yeah, or like finding someone that knows how to create a browser extension, or a scraper or something like that. And so that&#8217;s always something that I tell someone looking to get started with a website where, you know, it might be easier to get started with this other service now, and it might be okay with your needs now, but if you outgrow that website or that service, it&#8217;s more difficult to bring it elsewhere later.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re working on different ways with the data liberation initiative where we&#8217;re looking at ways to make our data more portable from other platforms to other platforms. And so I really feel strongly about that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, that&#8217;s the strongest point, one of the strongest points of WordPress is that you own your content, you control it, there&#8217;s no algorithm changes, you know, on Facebook where all of a sudden people aren&#8217;t seeing your content. They change a feature, right? People can&#8217;t react a certain way to your content anymore, and it affects your traffic to your site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I always strongly emphasise that to people, because people don&#8217;t think about that. They think I just need a website, right? But they don&#8217;t think about, what happens if I need to make changes and this software doesn&#8217;t work, or this service doesn&#8217;t help me anymore?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:36] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> We&#8217;ve definitely moved as a community, and by community I don&#8217;t mean the WordPress community, I mean the community of online users. We&#8217;ve definitely moved towards more gatekeeping and siloed consent repositories. You know, you think of things like social media, and essentially anything where there&#8217;s a, you know, a username and a password and a paywall. We seem to be more at peace with that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that brings me to the next thing actually. And I&#8217;m sorry if this comment lands badly, dear listener, but I think there is something quite curious about our community. I think we are full of people who are very well intentioned, who have extremely benevolent motives, and often, I think, regard commercial things sometimes as something to be viewed with a little bit of suspicion. I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;ve detected this kind of thing as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All of those things are things which drew me in. They didn&#8217;t alienate me. They were exactly the kind of people that I wanted to be around. But I do wonder if WordPress&#8217; history, so the .com, .org history over the last, let&#8217;s say 15 years or so, I do wonder if the flavor, the colour of the community, if you like, that we&#8217;ve got meant that we were going to have problems about this .com, .org split.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because on the one side, fierce, fierce open source advocacy people. You must own your own content. You&#8217;ve got to be able to download the software. This is terribly important, you want to be able to fork it at a moment&#8217;s notice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then on the other hand, a bunch of people are, well, that&#8217;s great you do that, but I&#8217;m happy over here. I&#8217;ll pay my fee for the premium version of wordpress.com. That&#8217;s fine with me. I&#8217;m okay with that. I don&#8217;t need all the bells and whistles that you seem to have. I don&#8217;t need it to be this version and that version. I don&#8217;t need this plugin or that thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I do wonder if the community that we&#8217;ve got is a part of that. In the mix somewhere is just what we&#8217;ve got. The people that are drawn to open source are going to view the .com side of things with a little bit of suspicion, and maybe see that, you know, that&#8217;s something which, gosh, we should not have that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:46] <strong>Jonathan Desrosiers:</strong> The only thing I&#8217;d challenge you on there is that I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s fair to say that people on the .com side don&#8217;t also care about the open source ideals. I think that many of them, if not all of them, do care about the underlying principles there. I think that, you always hear, you have to look after your own, right? You have to make sure you can pay your bills and you have a business and you. I&#8217;m US based, the American dream, right? Of creating a business and growing that into something sizable that can help people and benefit many.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so that&#8217;s my only pushback there is that they do. It&#8217;s not a binary thing. It&#8217;s definitely an overlap. And I like to think that there&#8217;s more overlap than we think. And that might be a little naive, but I do tend to think that it overlaps pretty heavily in that section there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:29] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I think you are right, and I think what you&#8217;ve done there is uncovered the poor way that I phrased what I was saying. I think when I was trying to describe that I was, although I didn&#8217;t say it, I was trying to describe things from the .org point of view only. And so the nature of that community is fiercely protective of the open source values there and what have you. So yeah, you&#8217;re quite right. It felt, with a bit of hindsight, it felt like that question was coming from both sides and it really wasn&#8217;t. So thank you for picking me up on that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:01] <strong>Jonathan Desrosiers:</strong> It&#8217;s normal to be skeptical of other people, right? Especially when you see all these horror stories of this big business, you know, draining these businesses out there that are draining money out of everybody and raising prices and profits are through the roof, right? So it&#8217;s normal to have this skepticism towards commercial entities, and that they&#8217;re trying to do the right things and things of that nature.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But to that, I just say to look at how the company and the space is contributing back and how they are ensuring that they do get their fair share of the WordPress pie, that is billions of dollars, on the last publishing that I saw, last report that I saw. But also making sure that that ecosystem is still strong, and supportive of everybody in the pool. To make sure that we can all compete to, you know, there&#8217;s definitely competition. We&#8217;re all going to compete together to make sure we&#8217;re trying to get more of the pie, right? And try to prove that our service or our products are the best.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, yeah, so I think a little level of skepticism is healthy. You always hear, assume good intent. I think that&#8217;s very important, and to obviously judge people by their actions and what they do to help grow that open source community while they&#8217;re living in that .com commercial space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, I don&#8217;t know, Michelle, if you have anything to add there. You probably have a different lens as the non-developer background.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:19] <strong>Michelle Frechette:</strong> Definitely the non-developer background here. So you used the word community when you talked about that when you first started the question, and I think we have to think about the fact that the community, although it does encompass both .com users and anybody who&#8217;s self-hosted through .org. It really is the lion&#8217;s share of that community comes from that self-hosted .org side. Comes from the people who go to Meetups. Comes from the people who attend WordCamps. And most importantly, it comes from the people who contribute to the ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether that&#8217;s by volunteering through the .org and Make WordPress, whether that&#8217;s selling a product, or having a podcast or any of the things, a newsletter, any of the things that contribute to the success of WordPress overall, it applies across the board. But when you look at all of the volunteerism, and all of the unsponsored people, and even sponsored people who are creating, right? So Jonathan is a developer, he&#8217;s in the weeds with it. He&#8217;s got a sense of pride with what the community creates for each other.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And when you have a sense of pride in what you do, you have a loyalty to that as well. And so we are part of a group of people, a huge group of people, a multimillion group of people worldwide who are this .org community with some .com community peppered in. So of course there&#8217;s going to be skew, one direction versus the other.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s necessarily derision. That I don&#8217;t think people like necessarily look at .com and go, ugh, what do they say? The redheaded stepchild of, you know, .org or whatever. I think it&#8217;s more along the lines of, we know this, we use this. We want other people to use this too. This is our community and this is what we&#8217;ve built this community around.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I think that democratising publishing is used by both, right? So if you look at .org and .com, we talk about democratising publishing. And the free .com allows people in incredibly socioeconomically depressed areas, and who have very little side income to be able to start a website. The ability to do that, whether it&#8217;s a website to talk about a service that they offer. Whether it&#8217;s a website just to blog. Whether they&#8217;re trying to monetize or not, there&#8217;s opportunities for people around the world to create a free, absolutely free website on .com.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And have it say, you know, michellefrechette.wordpress.com, because that&#8217;s what I could afford at the time. And then when I can, I either upgrade to paid, or I port that over to a self-hosted situation. So I think that both of them really have an amazing place in our ecosystem, but we tend not to see that when we sit squarely in one side or the other.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:02] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Do you know? That&#8217;s a really interesting point, and one I cannot believe I&#8217;ve never thought about that. Over all these many years of thinking about WordPress and all of its different flavors and things, wordpress.org carries the word free around with it in my head. I&#8217;m thinking wordpress.org, free. I&#8217;m struggling to imagine a scenario where it is entirely free to deploy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:25] <strong>Michelle Frechette:</strong> I used to say WordPress is free like a free puppy. A free puppy, you still have to take to the vet, and buy food, and get their nails trimmed, and buy the leash, and all of the things that go along with a free puppy. WordPress.org is like that. It&#8217;s a free puppy. You still have to pay for hosting and pay for themes, and I mean, you couldn&#8217;t do it fairly inexpensively, but not a hundred percent free.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:44] <strong>Jonathan Desrosiers:</strong> I was just going to add in, likewise, it&#8217;s not free to get to the point where it&#8217;s published. And another thing that you brought up, Michelle, that made me think is, I mentioned about judging companies based on how they contribute and the ideals they follow. But that also is true for the individuals that spend their personal time, or self sponsor, to contribute to the software.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so they are not looking, most likely, not looking for your business. They may be if they&#8217;re a freelancer type thing. But in most cases they&#8217;re looking for just recognition, or maybe a job, or maybe sponsorship, so that they could continue to help the software grow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so there&#8217;s multiple lenses to that commercial side of things, right? Where we talked about .org versus .com, and commercial versus, open source. But within that, there&#8217;s also other layers of that as well where you&#8217;re contributing to make sure the software grows, so that your company continues to do good. But also maybe you just really enjoy the software and believe in it and want to contribute on your own to ensure that that same thing happens.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:46] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, interesting. I&#8217;m just going to finish off my thought from previously there. So the free to download bit, I think where I was going with that was that there&#8217;s a minimum of hosting. In order to get that free version of the software, the zip file that you download. In order to make it meaningful, you&#8217;ve got to at least do the hosting. The other bit, well, I suppose you could host it on your own computer, but good luck with that if you&#8217;re a newbie.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:09] <strong>Jonathan Desrosiers:</strong> I challenge that too, not necessarily, right? Like a website is only as good as who can access it, if they find what they&#8217;re looking for. But you could very easily just run WordPress on a Raspberry Pie somewhere in your basement that, you know, you use it to send requests to, to turn on your lights or something like that, or sync up your garage door. You know, you could theoretically use WordPress to do all these types of things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I would also challenge you to think outside the box a little bit on that. I&#8217;m not saying it&#8217;s a good idea and I&#8217;m not saying I might grunt at you when you come with your really weird obscure edge case in Trac, but that&#8217;s part of the great thing about WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:45] <strong>Michelle Frechette:</strong> But it&#8217;s possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:46] <strong>Jonathan Desrosiers:</strong> You can use WordPress in many different ways, with many different combinations of plugins and themes. And that makes WordPress great, but it also makes it incredibly difficult to maintain and ensure that backwards compatibility, which is one of our main pillars, is sustained release to release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:02] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It&#8217;s fascinating. Yeah, what insight that was. That&#8217;s remarkable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The commercial side, so the .com side where you&#8217;re paying a subscription if you want the different tiers and the abilities that you get for doing that, I don&#8217;t know if any of this data is available, whether it&#8217;s been published, whether it&#8217;s easy to access, I&#8217;m not sure. But I&#8217;m guessing that there is some through line between the profitability of the .com business side of things, and the open source project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We all know that many, many, many volunteers contribute to .org in every conceivable way. Whether that&#8217;s to the code, to events, to whatever it may be. But I&#8217;m imagining there is some connection. Maybe it&#8217;s attenuating a little bit more now. Maybe it was more in the past than it is now. But I&#8217;m imagining that there is a connection between sales, unit sales of the .com out into the open world, and people being paid, seconded, and what have you, to work on the .org side.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I actually don&#8217;t know if there&#8217;s any truth in that, if there&#8217;s anything there, but I&#8217;m imagining there is. If the .com business pays for the .org side to be as successful as it is essentially is what I&#8217;m trying to say.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:18] <strong>Jonathan Desrosiers:</strong> Yeah, I mean, historically Automattic has been the most sizable contributor to the project. There&#8217;s something called the Five for the Future Project, which is basically a challenge to companies, or individuals, making a living on WordPress to contribute 5% of their time back to the project. It&#8217;s a great initiative. That&#8217;s something that I was hired to participate in, so I&#8217;m very thankful for that because I&#8217;m able to have employment to work on open source software because of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there are some flaws with it in that 5% isn&#8217;t right for everyone. It&#8217;s a goal, right? It&#8217;s, I&#8217;ve talked about this at WordCamps in the past, but time is not necessarily a good measure because it doesn&#8217;t measure the impact you have, or the productivity, or the efficiency that you have, right? So you could spend one hour working on this one bug fix that could fix screen reader software for millions of people accessing sites across the world. That&#8217;s very meaningful and that has a very strong impact. But that&#8217;s very hard to measure. And hours is certainly not the way that you can measure that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s a good idea. I like that a lot of people rallied behind that, and that it&#8217;s a very strong program. There&#8217;s a lot of participants. I&#8217;m looking forward to the next iteration of that, which a lot of community members are discussing and, you know, I&#8217;m sure leadership is always thinking about that as well. Like, how can we improve this and encourage more people to contribute and give back?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I guess all that to say that, you know, I guess .com and Automattic have contributed a sizable amount to the project over its history, and many other companies as well have historically contributed a lot back too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:53] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So another thing that I wanted to discuss, which we haven&#8217;t discussed so far is the sort of different feature set that you get, and the evolution of that over time. So if I was to get a .com site back, I don&#8217;t know, 12 years ago, the things that I could do with that would be different to what I can do now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Obviously with the .org side, all bets are off. You can do what you wish with that. It&#8217;s yours. You can do anything you like. But on the .com side, it was limited in certain ways. The software was designed presumably to facilitate whatever it was that their agenda items were, whether that was profitability, growth, simplicity to use, whatever those metrics were.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Where are we at at the moment? Because it kind of feels like the two are coalescing, especially from a UI point of view. It feels like there&#8217;s moves at the moment to make the .com side be brought in line with the .org side. So the .org UI it feels like is going to be made available or pushed into the .com side.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that kind of feels curious to me. It always felt that the UI was a big differentiator, like, you know, it looks different, you can immediately see that&#8217;s a .com website. Maybe in the future it won&#8217;t be. So let&#8217;s just talk around that. What are the differences in what you can do with the platforms? And then maybe we can get onto the UI and the UX.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:08] <strong>Michelle Frechette:</strong> So the free .com versus the upgraded paid plans have very different things that you can do within them. And then the paid plans are almost identical to what you can do with self-hosted. And so the difference really is you&#8217;re looking at the free plan versus any upgraded paid plan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And with the free plan, you&#8217;re very limited into plugins and themes. There are very few that you can choose from. There&#8217;s more now than there were 10 or 15 years ago for sure. And I think my experience with logging into a free .com site looks different now than it did 10 or 12 years ago as well. But it still looks different than it does on a self-hosted WordPress installation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That does change with an upgrade plan, because now you have a lot more features that you can add, you can bring in plugins, you can change a lot of the way that things look through CSS or through customisation. And so, yes, I think that the paid plan and the self-hosted are very much in sync with one another.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the free plan still looks, to me at least, a lot different. And when I tried to add CSS to what it said, oh, you need to upgrade to do that, which I understand, right? So if they gave away everything, then there would be no money coming into the company to be able to operate and to pay the employees that actually work at Automattic. So yeah, I think there is still a difference. And I know that Jonathan probably knows a lot more about the technical differences than I do, but that&#8217;s my experiential difference.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:40:38] <strong>Jonathan Desrosiers:</strong> Well, one interesting fact is that wordpress.com is just one multi-site. So when you create a site, it&#8217;s just all in the same instance of WordPress. You just have your own space on that install.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:40:48] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> That is truly remarkable by the way. That is a quite numbing thought when you actually ponder that for a moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:40:54] <strong>Jonathan Desrosiers:</strong> For anyone that&#8217;s worked with multi-site, you know how challenging it is to have 10 sites, nevermind millions of sites. So it&#8217;s definitely impressive and interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;d also add that, you know, Michelle has talked a lot about more the personal style plans, right? Where we mentioned you get a free site if you have your site at nathan.wordpress.com. You can pay, you know, to get a domain, like I mentioned is the next plan. And then you can pay for more things like different plugins and different backups, whatever the features are that they offer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But after you get past that, there&#8217;s additional tiers for people like agencies. There&#8217;s very, very high level, reliable hosting for companies that run Fortune 500 companies, Fortune 10 companies, whatever it is that they need more handholding. They need you to help them with engineering maybe with their team. There&#8217;s tiers all the way up to that level at Automattic. And I think it&#8217;s fair to say that any, you know, they have plans that compete with any different tier that may be out there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s e-commerce plans and all of that. And, you know, at Bluehost we have e-commerce plans. We have managed plans just like they do. And like I said, before, we&#8217;re all trying to have our special sauce to make our home the best place to WordPress and for you to come and want to set up your site and make a living on us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:42:09] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So then back to the question of the, what feels like an endeavor to make the .com look a lot like the .org. Now that was something that I caught sight of not that long ago. It was probably, maybe, I want to say about eight weeks ago, something like that. I don&#8217;t know if either of you caught that piece of news, and whether or not that&#8217;s in fact moving forward. But the idea is to make a default version of .org basically identical in terms of look and feel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I found that curious. I wondered what the intention was there. Was it purely just to have, I don&#8217;t know, one base of software that could be relied upon for both, or whether it was to make it easier to do a migration in either direction? I don&#8217;t know. So, I don&#8217;t know if either of you do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:42:48] <strong>Jonathan Desrosiers:</strong> So a little, I guess a little history is that wordpress.com used to use the same dashboard as .org. And a while ago there was a project called Calypso, and that is basically the dashboard that you know probably from the last five years or so. And I can&#8217;t confirm this, but I believe that it was an exploration on what the dashboard, what a new WordPress dashboard could be. And I think that they&#8217;ve realised that having your own dashboard that&#8217;s different than .org is not really the best path.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there&#8217;s a few reasons for that. One is that we mentioned you have millions of sites on .com, right? That&#8217;s all very valuable feedback from using the software. And if they&#8217;re using a different dashboard than everybody that&#8217;s not on wordpress.com, that&#8217;s basically lost opportunities to receive feedback on the software that we&#8217;re building. And so that&#8217;s one aspect.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the other aspect is that, if you have a different dashboard, you have to have people maintaining that different dashboard, and making sure it works with all the new features that are added to wordpress.org. Make sure it&#8217;s sustainable and performant and all of this requires resources. But if you could adapt your products to use the same dashboard that everybody else has, then maybe you could take some of those resources and put them back to the .org software, instead of the internal Calypso project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I should correct that, it wasn&#8217;t an internal project, it was used internally. It is open source and, especially initially there was a lot of encouragement for community members to participate in that. And so it&#8217;s not like it was a closed thing where they shut everybody out and they wanted, you know, it to be their own thing. It wasn&#8217;t trade secret type stuff. It was open source.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, yeah, those are just two things that stand out to me as reasons why you would want to use the same experience that everybody else has, as it just contributes to the greater good of the software and the health of the ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:44:45] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, it&#8217;s interesting, and again, something I hadn&#8217;t really thought about. The heuristics that would come out of .com. Well, for a start, it&#8217;s incredibly cohesive. That data set is going to be enormous, whereas trying to gather that from all the other versions of WordPress, you would obviously have to opt people into that to begin with. But also, it would be very difficult to gather all of that, whereas presumably the .com side of things has got that completely sealed up. So yeah, again, really interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is curious. I don&#8217;t really know if we&#8217;ll ever overcome in people&#8217;s heads the, well, for some people I think it&#8217;s a chasm. You know, it&#8217;s a really big divide, the difference between .org and .com. But I think we&#8217;ve done a fairly good job of explaining what the history is, why the things have been done in the way that they&#8217;ve been done, maybe a little bit into the future and how things are going to look.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t know if there&#8217;s any salient point that you think we missed there, but if not, I think we&#8217;ll round it up. So I&#8217;ll just ask Michelle first. Anything you wanted to get across about that before we knock it on the head?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:45:43] <strong>Michelle Frechette:</strong> I think that we often talk about .org versus .com as though they were adversarial, but it&#8217;s really just a comparison as opposed to one being better than the other. I think you choose the option that&#8217;s best for you and your goals, and there&#8217;s nothing wrong with choosing any of those options.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:46:02] <strong>Jonathan Desrosiers:</strong> Yeah, I&#8217;d just add that with any technology or anything, knowledge is not always binary, right? It&#8217;s a spectrum. And so how can we better expose people to the concepts, better explain them to people so that it&#8217;s easier to understand and get up to speed on what different concepts are. Technical concepts, brand concepts, whatever that may be, software, and strive for simplicity, right? That&#8217;s our, one of our philosophies. And so how can we make things more simple so that more people are able to better understand and be empowered to have a better online presence by having a greater understanding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:46:37] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Well, thank you both for picking that puzzle apart with me. That&#8217;s been really interesting. So Michelle Frechette and Jonathan Desrosiers, thank you both for joining me today. Really appreciate it. Thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:46:46] <strong>Michelle Frechette:</strong> Thanks for having us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:46:46] <strong>Jonathan Desrosiers:</strong> Always a pleasure.

She’s a prolific freelancer, podcaster, and a driving force behind many WordPress initiatives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jonathan is a WordPress core committer, contributing to the project since 2013, and has been sponsored by Bluehost to work on WordPress core since 2018. His work largely takes place behind the scenes, supporting contributors, maintaining build tools, and keeping WordPress running smoothly for millions of users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’ve ever searched for “WordPress” online, you’ve probably found both WordPress.com and WordPress.org at the top of your results, and, like many, you might be unsure what really separates the two.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, Michelle and Jonathan help clear up the history, philosophy, and practical differences between WordPress.com and WordPress.org. They talk about how these two flavours of WordPress came to be, why they’ve both been key to WordPress’ growth, and the ways they overlap and differ in features, user experience, and monetisation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle shares her perspective as a long-time user and advocate, with experience across both .com and .org sites, while Jonathan dives into the technical and historical details from his core contributor vantage point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They also explore whether the naming conventions .com and .org have helped or hindered the project, and how the WordPress community’s open source ethos shapes the ongoing conversation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Along the way, they touch on how .com made WordPress accessible in the early days, the importance of data portability, and evolving efforts to unify the user experience between the two platforms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’ve ever wondered which version of WordPress is right for you, why the project seems split into two variants, or how community and commerce intertwine in the WordPress ecosystem, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Useful links</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.blogger.com/about/\"> Blogger</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p> Michelle&#8217;s <a href=\"https://wptrailbuddies.wordpress.com/\">WP Trail Buddies</a> on WordPress.com</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://thehistoryoftheweb.com/the-story-of-wordpress/\"> The story of forking b2</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bluehost.com/\">Bluehost</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p> <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/data-liberation/\">Data Liberation</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/five-for-the-future/\"> Five for the Future</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso\"> Calypso</a></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 20 Aug 2025 14:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Nathan Wrigley\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:35;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:21:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:72:\"HeroPress: The Stone That Turned Out to Be Gold – My WordPress Journey\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://heropress.com/?post_type=heropress-essays&p=8146\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:188:\"https://heropress.com/essays/the-stone-that-turned-out-to-be-gold-my-wordpress-journey/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=the-stone-that-turned-out-to-be-gold-my-wordpress-journey\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10325:\"<img alt=\"Pull quote: WordPress is gold.

I just wanted to know what the fuss was about so I could talk with authority the next time it came up. What I didn’t know was that I was picking up a stone that would later prove to be gold — taking me from clueless newbie to community leader, and from replacing demo content to designing websites for real clients… and even offer consultancy services</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><em>“The thing you throw away may be the thing you look for tomorrow.”</em> — Ugandan Proverb</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-scratching-in-the-sand\"><strong>Scratching in the Sand</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>People often ask me:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“Moses, tell us about your WordPress journey.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I always laugh and say: <em>“Ah, my friend, it’s the story of the stone that turned out to be gold.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In life, we pick things here and there.

He had just started using it to build sites and was offering to journey with some people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I thought: <em>“Hmm… let me check this thing for myself. If it’s nonsense, at least I’ll know. And if it’s good, I can talk about it without looking like I just fell off the mango tree.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wasn’t looking for money. I just wanted to <em>have an opinion</em>. You see, I’m the kind of person who enjoys jumping into conversations with some authority — even if I learned the thing yesterday.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-my-first-meetup-lost-in-the-blocks\"><strong>My First Meetup – Lost in the Blocks</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>My first WordPress Meetup was all about Gutenberg. This was around 2018 — actually 2018. Gutenberg was super fresh and not even fully launched yet</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/privileged/\">Laurence</a> was introducing this “block editor” thing. Everyone was nodding seriously. Me? Everything went in through one ear and politely left through the other without even greeting my brain on the way out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just as I was wondering if I had wasted my time, someone said:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“If you’re here for the first time and you don’t understand anything, that’s okay.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Inside me, something jumped: <em>“Eh! That’s me you’re talking about!”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-mind-opener-offline-development\"><strong>The Mind-Opener: Offline Development</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, Mr. Lutaaya  introduced us to building WordPress sites offline.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My friend, this was a million Dollar revelation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Until then, I thought websites could only be built online — which meant needing fast internet and a good computer. And in Uganda? The Internet was like a stubborn goat — expensive and disappearing when you needed it most.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With XAMPP, I could build ten websites in a week without spending a coin on data. They were ugly, yes, but they were mine.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-falling-in-love-with-elementor\"><strong>Falling in Love With Elementor</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Not long after, I met Elementor. Ah! It was like discovering <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolex_(food)\">rolex</a> after years of plain <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapati\">chapati</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No coding headaches. Just drag, drop, and design. I paired it with the Astra theme plus Starter Templates (now called Starter Sites)  and started cranking out websites — or what I thought were websites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If a client needed a hospital site, I’d hunt for a hospital theme with demo data. School site? Same thing. All I did was replace demo pictures of dogs with cows, or gardeners with goat herders, and voilà — “Nice website!”</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-drupal-disaster-that-changed-me\"><strong>The Drupal Disaster That Changed Me</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Then came my humbling moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At WordCamp Kampala in 2019, a UCU student asked me to help her migrate her site from Drupal to WordPress. I said confidently: <em>“No problem!”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few hours later, I realized… big problem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This wasn’t a “replace the dog with a cow” job. It needed a full custom theme. I needed knowledge on custom design which I had never paid attention to. I had no clue how to make one from scratch. That day, I felt like a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boda_boda\">boda boda</a> rider asked to fly a helicopter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I failed her completely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But in that failure, a fire was lit. I decided to actually learn <strong>custom design</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-facing-real-problems\"><strong>Facing Real Problems</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>By January 2019, I built my company’s first fully custom site. It wasn’t perfect, but it taught me about responsiveness, optimization, and making sure a site looked good on desktop, laptop, and mobile. My first website was so beautiful on Desktop but so broken on Mobile. Everyone was complaining about it and I wasn’t seeing the problem until I saw it on my phone. Whoah, it looked so horrible that a witch’s house was more organized. Everything was flying to where it found peace but inside my heart, I was happy with the learning curve that was super achievable.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This was no longer a hobby. I was in deep. Curiosity building into a desire</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few years later, I learned Divi. I learned Gutenberg properly now known as FSE (Full Site Editing). I even designed my first block editor site and felt like a genius. A few years later, I used the block editor to design an entire WordCamp website, with a friend (a member from the local community) — and it worked beautifully.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-finding-the-real-gold-community\"><strong>Finding the Real Gold: Community</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The real treasure, though, wasn’t Elementor, Divi, or even my first paying client. It was the <strong>WordPress community</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other tech communities can be stingy with knowledge. In WordPress, people shared openly. Sometimes the knowledge shared required resources that even cost money but people still offered. In my very first days Rogers offered me a starter package with hosting and management and by then we were using the .ml and .tk domains from FreeNom since it was free. The people I met in the community teach you how to do the exact thing they do for a living — no gatekeeping, no “first pay me &#8211; Awesome, Right? I thought so too.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I realized:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><em>Contributing to WordPress is like washing the plate you ate on.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s a privilege, not a burden.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-from-local-meetups-to-the-white-house\"><strong>From Local Meetups to the White House</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve spoken at Meetups, organized WordCamps, helped beginners install WordPress for the first time, and served in multiple WordPress teams.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I’ve seen where WordPress can go. It powers embassy websites. It’s used by the Ugandan State House. It even runs the White House site in the USA.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the White House trusts it, my friend, no one can convince me otherwise.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-from-rock-to-treasure\"><strong>From Rock to Treasure</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I joined WordPress at version 4.9. Now we’re in the 6.x series. I’ve grown alongside it — from a confused attendee to a community leader, from a “text-replacing” novice to a custom developer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I picked up WordPress, I thought it was a useless rock. But when I washed it, shaped it, and put it in the fire, it gleamed like gold.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>WordPress is gold.</strong> Pure and simple.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><em>“The thing you throw away may be the thing you look for tomorrow.

After several thoughtful discussions and planning sessions, the series was finalized and officially kicked off on March 14, 2025. The complete nine‑event series was organized through the <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/wpkolhapur/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">WordCamp Kolhapur Meetup group</a>, with <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/hiabhaykulkarni/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Abhay Kulkarni</a> organizing and volunteering for every meetup to ensure smooth coordination. I served as the speaker and mentor for each session, guiding both new and experienced contributors through various areas of the WordPress project.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why We Started the Contribution Series</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I was a mentee in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2024/11/21/wordpress-contributor-mentorship-2024-q4-cohort-graduates/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress Contributor Mentorship: 2024 Q4 Cohort</a> and successfully graduated from the program in November 2024. During this journey, I not only learned how to contribute effectively to WordPress Core, but I was also recognized as an <em>All-Star Mentee</em> and earned a place in the program’s <em>Hall of Fame</em>!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, I received a <a href=\"https://asia.wordcamp.org/2025/wordcamp-asia-2025-scholarship-recipients/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Diversity Scholarship</em> to attend WordCamp Asia 2025</a>. These scholarships are designed to support individuals who are passionate about contributing to the WordPress ecosystem but may face financial or logistical challenges.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Inspired by my cohort experience and the opportunities I received, I wanted to give back to the community. What better way than by becoming a mentor myself, guiding and inspiring others to start their own contribution journey?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that’s the core reason we started the WordPress Contribution Series.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Event Recap</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>After the planning and preparation, here’s how the contribution series unfolded across different meetup topics:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Kickstart Your WordPress Contribution Journey</h3>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Date:</strong> March 15, 2025</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>This opening session focused on getting contributors started with the basics — setting up a WordPress.org <a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/lesson-plan/creating-a-wordpress-org-account/\">profile</a>, joining global Slack channels, and understanding the various Make WordPress teams.

(I would love to see the results of a longer overnight or all-weekend hackathon.)</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-3 is-cropped is-style-rectangular wp-block-gallery-1 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-147970\" height=\"403\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/ma.tt/files/2025/08/MPC-HackathonNYC-20250816_389-1024x683.jpg?resize=604%2C403&#038;quality=89&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"604\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-147969\" height=\"403\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/ma.tt/files/2025/08/MPC-HackathonNYC-20250816_884-1024x683.jpg?resize=604%2C403&#038;quality=89&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"604\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-147972\" height=\"403\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/ma.tt/files/2025/08/MPC-HackathonNYC-20250816_1384-1024x683.jpg?resize=604%2C403&#038;quality=89&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"604\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-147963\" height=\"403\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/ma.tt/files/2025/08/MPC-HackathonNYC-20250816_757-1024x683.jpg?resize=604%2C403&#038;quality=89&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"604\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-147968\" height=\"403\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/ma.tt/files/2025/08/MPC-HackathonNYC-20250816_1259-1024x683.jpg?resize=604%2C403&#038;quality=89&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"604\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-147962\" height=\"403\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/ma.tt/files/2025/08/MPC-HackathonNYC-20250816_832-1024x683.jpg?resize=604%2C403&#038;quality=89&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"604\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-147977\" height=\"403\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/ma.tt/files/2025/08/MPC-HackathonNYC-20250816_1462-1024x683.jpg?resize=604%2C403&#038;quality=89&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"604\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-147973\" height=\"403\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/ma.tt/files/2025/08/MPC-HackathonNYC-20250816_1254-1024x683.jpg?resize=604%2C403&#038;quality=89&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"604\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-147974\" height=\"403\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/ma.tt/files/2025/08/MPC-HackathonNYC-20250816_1027-1024x683.jpg?resize=604%2C403&#038;quality=89&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"604\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-147975\" height=\"403\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/ma.tt/files/2025/08/MPC-HackathonNYC-20250816_1053-1024x683.jpg?resize=604%2C403&#038;quality=89&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"604\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-147966\" height=\"403\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/ma.tt/files/2025/08/MPC-HackathonNYC-20250816_1938-1024x683.jpg?resize=604%2C403&#038;quality=89&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"604\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-147965\" height=\"403\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/ma.tt/files/2025/08/MPC-HackathonNYC-20250816_2067-1024x683.jpg?resize=604%2C403&#038;quality=89&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"604\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-147967\" height=\"403\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/ma.tt/files/2025/08/MPC-HackathonNYC-20250816_2001-1024x683.jpg?resize=604%2C403&#038;quality=89&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"604\" /></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For a wrap-up of the winners, <a href=\"https://x.com/AlexReibman/status/1957194025271808088\">check out this great X/Twitter thread by Alex Reibman</a>.

Yusuf Olokoba said the name was inspired by <a href=\"https://x.com/levelsio\">Pieter Levels</a>, which is pretty cool.

For free and lower-priced accounts it runs a version of WordPress called <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/advanced-administration/multisite/create-network/\">WordPress MS</a>, or WordPress Multisite, which is designed for super-efficient multi-tenant usage, which is what has allowed it to introduce hundreds of millions of people to WordPress and run at a huge scale. (It was <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2006/10/mu-and-bbpress/\">initially called MU</a>, for multi-user, but we had to change it because someone squatted the name WPMU and built a business on top that was confusing users with commercial products. Such is my curse.) It revolutionized the hosting industry in a number of ways, including acclimating customers to per-site pricing instead of unlimited domains and raising the bar for what a host would manage for users so they didn&#8217;t have to worry. It has also provided a highly secure base login, which allows us to offer popular SaaS services, such as <a href=\"https://jetpack.com/support/jetpack-stats/\">statistics</a> and <a href=\"https://akismet.com/\">anti-spam</a>, to all WordPress users, regardless of where they&#8217;re hosted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At higher-priced plans you&#8217;d get access to not just a curated set of plugins and themes but the ability to install anything you like from the ecosystem, which invisibly switches your account to <a href=\"http://wp.cloud/\">WP.cloud</a> in the backend that supports unlimited plugins and themes and custom code, in a way that&#8217;s still multi-datacenter and maintenance-free. This has been very successful and works great for a ton of customers, but it still puts an asterisk when you recommend WordPress.com to someone because they&#8217;d need to be on one of the higher-priced plans to get an experience of WordPress with custom plugins and themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the first time ever <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/blog/2025/08/12/for-a-limited-time-unlock-plugin-power-on-personal-premium-plans/\">we&#8217;re running a summer special where every single paid account gets that full WP.cloud experience</a> with full customization and control. It&#8217;s a test we&#8217;re running until August 25<sup>th</sup>. It&#8217;s WordPress, without the asterisk, without limits, implemented in a way that&#8217;s intuitive and safe for novice users, while also being extremely powerful for developers. If you haven&#8217;t checked out WP.com in a while, it&#8217;s a great deal starting at just $4 per month. I&#8217;m curious to see the results of how this goes.

The people, the events, the plugins, the blocks, the themes, and in this case, rebranding Do the Woo, and growing openchannels.fm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to subscribe to the podcast, you can do that by searching for WP Tavern in your podcast player of choice, or by going to wptavern.com/feed/podcast, and you can copy that URL into most podcast players.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a topic that you&#8217;d like us to feature on the podcast, I&#8217;m keen to hear from you and hopefully get you, or your idea, featured on the show. Head to wptavern.com/contact/jukebox, and use the form there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So on the podcast today, we have Bob Dunn. Bob is a long standing figure in the WordPress community, having branded himself as BobWP back in 2010. With nearly two decades of experience in WordPress, Bob has become one of the most recognizable voices in WordPress podcasting. Producing shows that have educated, inspired, and connected countless developers, builders, and enthusiasts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most recently, he launched Open Channels FM, a rebrand and expansion from his well-known Do the Woo podcast, which was originally focused on WooCommerce, but now explores broader topics around the open web, open source, and the wider maker community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bob talks about his journey in podcasting, from running Do the Woo for almost seven years to the decision to rebrand and launch Open Channels FM. He explains why he felt it was time to broaden the focus, welcoming listeners from outside of just the WooCommerce and WordPress ecosystem, and how that led to a network approach with multiple channels and series.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bob describes how Open Channels is structured. Rather than traditional shows, the network features three flexible channels, Open Makers, Open Source Reach, and Open Web Conversations, each hosting a variety of series. This lets content stay organized and evergreen, and accommodates the 25 to 30 rotating hosts with the freedom to produce series across different topics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bob talks about the challenges, and rewards, of handing over the mic, stepping into a more of a managerial and founder role and how he&#8217;s building a sustainable, collaborative, podcasting network.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We discuss Bob&#8217;s technical approach as well, including how he uses WordPress to manage multiple RSS feeds and subscriptions, making it easy for listeners to follow specific channels or get the fire hose of all content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bob also shares insights on rebranding a podcast, managing redirects, retaining audiences, updating hundreds of featured images, and ensuring continuity without confusing listeners.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in open source podcasting, or building community driven content, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in finding out more, you can find all of the links in the show notes by heading to wptavern.com/podcast, where you&#8217;ll find all the other episodes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so without further delay, I bring you Bob Dunn.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:37] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I am joined on the podcast by Bob Dunn. Hello Bob.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:40] <strong>Bob Dunn:</strong> Hey, hello Nathan. Great to be back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:42] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Thank you so much for joining me today. Bob and I have been chatting for quite a long time. Actually over many years, we&#8217;ve been chatting for quite a long time, because we&#8217;re both very, very, very into the exact same thing, and that is podcasting in the WordPress space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Should anybody not have heard of you, Bob, I know it&#8217;s a bit of a generic question. Do you mind doing your little potted bio to tell us who you are, and what you&#8217;ve been doing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:04] <strong>Bob Dunn:</strong> Been in business a long time. Two major businesses, branded myself, BobWP in 2010. Did a lot of stuff between then and now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, yeah, right now I am doing openchannels.fm. I&#8217;m running that, that is a podcast channels with, actually three channels, we&#8217;ll be explaining more about that. But yeah, I&#8217;ve just been in WordPress quite a while and I think since, oh, I don&#8217;t know, about 17, 18 years or so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:34] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, it&#8217;s a fairly long time. You were one of the voices, when I joined the WordPress space, you were the established podcast voice I think. There were a few, but not many. And there&#8217;s very few that have survived. You&#8217;ve managed to, turn a living out of podcasting in the WordPress space. So Bravo, well done.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:50] <strong>Bob Dunn:</strong> Thank you. Yeah, it&#8217;s been interesting. It&#8217;s something you just kind of keep going and, you know, doing it all yourself. It gets to a point where, yeah, it&#8217;s a lot of work, but it&#8217;s paid off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:00] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So a little while ago, I&#8217;m going to say about, I don&#8217;t know, six months ago, something like that, you can correct me in a moment. But for the longest period of time you&#8217;ve had Do the Woo. Prior to Do the Woo, there was a bunch of other naming conventions for your podcast. What was it that, in the most recent past, why did you decide to jettison Do the Woo and create openchannels?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Open channels, by the way, you can be found at openchannels.fm. There&#8217;s no hyphens or anything. It&#8217;s just as you&#8217;d imagine, openchannels.fm. Go and check that out. You&#8217;d be able to see what we&#8217;re talking about. What was the reasoning behind that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:35] <strong>Bob Dunn:</strong> Yeah, so I actually did the rebrand early June. It was at WordCamp Europe, but I&#8217;d been thinking about it for about a year. So you have almost seven years under the belt with Do the Woo, and it started out as a WooCommerce focused podcasts. And over the years I added more WordPress into it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then over the last couple years I started talking about a bit more of the, you know, even outside the WordPress bubble. And I felt like something was always missing, because it&#8217;s kind of two-prong where WordPress developers, builders, a lot of our audience need to also be aware of other stuff that is going on around them. I&#8217;m not trying to push somebody one direction or another. It&#8217;s like just know stuff that is happening out there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then also for people that don&#8217;t know WooCommerce, expanding on that, trying to bring them in on other topics. They would look at WooCommerce or they look at WordPress and say, hey, you know, I&#8217;ve never really dug into them. I listen to a few of these.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The two major things that really, I had been chewing on for like, oh man, it had to be almost a year, was growth and sustainability of the site. And, you know, it worked great when it was really WooCommerce focus, but people had the impression that, if they know Woo, they&#8217;d look at it and say, oh, it&#8217;s a WooCommerce podcast. I&#8217;m not going to check it out because I&#8217;m not using WooCommerce.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then of course, people that didn&#8217;t know anything about it, they would maybe think it&#8217;s, I don&#8217;t know, some wrapper or something. I don&#8217;t know what, you know, the title is like, it didn&#8217;t really define it. And of course they dig in a little bit, they learn what it is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, yeah, that was the impetus. It was like, I thought, man, it&#8217;s time to, as hard as it is to change a brand or even drop one that has worked for you, I thought we are moving more into content around the open web, open source, fediverse, all these different things. And I really want to make this something where, like I said before, people that don&#8217;t know WordPress or WooCommerce would come and listen to other stuff and maybe they&#8217;d check it out, maybe they don&#8217;t.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the WordPress people would continue, because we still have that content in there and they could learn about other stuff. They could learn about things that probably will really help their business even staying in WordPress. So I&#8217;m not, again, trying to push them out of it, it&#8217;s just open your mind a bit and learn new things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:14] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> The wisdom that I often get when I read around the podcast industry, and if you are just a consumer of podcasts and you&#8217;ve never really dug into that industry, in the same way that WordPress has just a gigantic amount in the background, as soon as you prize open the can and realise that there&#8217;s this whole open source software, and there&#8217;s events and all of that, the same is true inside of podcasting. There&#8217;s a whole industry going on in the background that you may not realise is there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And one of the pieces of sage advice which is often delivered, is to kind of niche down when you are beginning your podcast. Because obviously, you are going to be a small fish in a very big pond. And so the more specific that you can get, the more likely you are to build up that audience over time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I&#8217;m guessing that that&#8217;s kind why you went with Do the Woo? So that it was pretty clear at the beginning, okay, we&#8217;re really focusing on Woo. So have you noticed that the pivot away from that, so from Do the Woo as a name, even though there was more content in there, to this much more open channel, so open source, whatever that might cover. Has your audience kind of, and I don&#8217;t really want to use the word forgiven, maybe I want to use the words, gone with you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Have they come across that brand transition willingly, or do you sense that some people have, you know, lost interest because now it&#8217;s not just Do the Woo? Because that&#8217;s, I suppose, something you have to be mindful of.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:29] <strong>Bob Dunn:</strong> Yeah. You know, I&#8217;m sure some have maybe decided differently, but the interesting thing is how I built it and how I, even after the launch, reorganised it even more, is that all the content that was on there is still on there and continues to be on there. And so as I looked at how can I best organise it, I first put it into like five shows, and it still didn&#8217;t quite make sense and gel. So I thought, well, what if I do three channels, and I have an open source reach channel, an open web conversations channel, and an open makers channel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A lot of the WordPress and Woo stuff went under the open makers channel. So now we still have series, like three or four series on WordPress. At least three series on WooCommerce, and then a variety of other stuff. So the thing was to get people convinced, and when I talked to a lot of people and I was at WordCamp Europe, you know, it&#8217;s like, it&#8217;s basically the brand is changing, we&#8217;re expanding, but the stuff you&#8217;ve been listening to is not going away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I have to really emphasise that. And it&#8217;s, yeah, there&#8217;s a bit where you think, oh, you know, am I going to lose it? But then they may come back, they may actually see that, yes, this is still existing, you know, getting this stuff out in front of people. And also, there will be now newer people that will, instead of looking at a name, Do the Woo and thinking, hmm, what do I do? Something like open channels, even though it is a lot broader, might interest them a little bit more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:56] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, there&#8217;s definitely the ability to tap into a new audience. So this podcast, WP Tavern, it has one show. And on a weekly basis we have a show and, you know, it&#8217;s me talking to somebody else. And I guess Do the Woo was a bit more like that. There was this one show and it would drop with a regular cadence and what have you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it may have escaped people because we didn&#8217;t really introduce it as such. But open channels is not that formula is it? It&#8217;s more of a, kind of like a network, I suppose, for want of a better word. You&#8217;ve got your own mini kind of network of podcasts. So let&#8217;s just dig into that a little bit. So you&#8217;ve iterated it a bit. You started with maybe three shows and now it&#8217;s up to however many, we&#8217;ll get into that. Do you just want to go through what all of the different shows are, and broadly what they cover?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:41] <strong>Bob Dunn:</strong> Yeah, so what happened is during this whole time of change, and some of this even happened before June, was that I had a whole bunch of shows. So you go to the thing and you&#8217;d see like, I don&#8217;t know, there was like 15 shows or something. And it seemed a bit too much to me. You&#8217;d go there and it&#8217;d be like, whoa, you know? Realistic, you&#8217;d think, okay, you&#8217;d find the show you like and stuff and listen to it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But as I was expanding the content I launched on June 5th with, there&#8217;s a website, there&#8217;s five shows and there&#8217;s some series under those five shows. And that still didn&#8217;t gel after I started getting in there and start rebranding it and working on it deeper, and I&#8217;m still working on it. I realised that what I&#8217;d like to do is eliminate the aspect of a show, so when they go there, it&#8217;s open channels, so it&#8217;s plural.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;ve got the three channels that I mentioned, and underneath all of those are series. So there&#8217;s several. Some of them, there&#8217;s quite a few series under open makers. There&#8217;s some under the other two channels. And the reason I did that is channels are a lot more flexible, and also series are incredibly flexible. If you have a show and you stop it, it&#8217;s like, bam, you know, people, oh, where did that go?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I thought, what if I had these three umbrella channels that I could put series in? I could start them up. Some of them have been going on forever. Some may just go on a few months, but they&#8217;re part of that whole stream under that channel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now everybody can go there and get all the podcasts that come in, or they can actually subscribe to the three channels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the series are just a variety under it. And I haven&#8217;t really, the series are often focused more when they happen, the name of the series. I mean, I decided putting all the series on the site would just confuse people more. It&#8217;d be like, oh, what?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then they can go through and they&#8217;ll see, you know, if they look through the episodes, they&#8217;ll see the various series. I mean, there&#8217;s, under open makers, there&#8217;s Woo Product Chat, there&#8217;s WP Behind the Builds, there&#8217;s WP Agency Tracks. And a lot of those were pre-existing. And so the other channels as well will have specific series under it, like Open Web Conversations has a series on the fediverse. One is on, oh man, I should have written some of this down. I can&#8217;t even remember all the series.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyway, there&#8217;s a few under that and there&#8217;s a few under open source. And what the beauty of it is too with as many hosts as we have now, I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s like around 25 to 30 hosts. They can pop around in different channels and under different series, or they come up with an idea for a show and we basically do it, and I say, okay, where should I pop that under? I can pop it under a series. It just makes it a lot more flexible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Talking about it makes it sound more confusing. Going to the site is a bit more cohesive. But the feedback I got from a lot of people, they loved the idea of the organisation and they loved the idea of expanding into more of the open web and open source stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:08] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, well, let&#8217;s get into that bit in a minute. But let&#8217;s just stick to the consumption of open channels. So if you go and subscribe in a podcast player, so, you know, typically on a phone or something like that, to this podcast, WP Tavern, it&#8217;s fairly straightforward. You either drop in the RSS feed, which is, you know, available, or you can type in WP Tavern, and that&#8217;s then saved. And every episode that we produce, including this one, will appear when it&#8217;s published.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How are you doing it for openchannels.fm? Because you&#8217;ve obviously got three channels, and then there&#8217;s different shows and series which live under that. How is it consumed? Is there just one overall RSS feed which will get you the lot? Or can you say, okay, I only want to, I don&#8217;t know, consume the stuff about the open makers or the open web conversations? How does it work?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:55] <strong>Bob Dunn:</strong> Yeah. What I&#8217;ve done is, you can, if you want the fire hose, you can go to openchannels.fm, it has its own feed, and then I do the feed for each of the channels. Like you said, open makers, open source and open web conversations. I thought of going down even more to every series, but I thought that just confuses people more so, you know, it encapsulates what each of those channels are about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, open makers is, somebody said, yeah, you know, it&#8217;s about people in tech making stuff. You make stuff, even if it&#8217;s WordPress only. Sometimes it&#8217;s interesting to hear how other people are making stuff. And it opens it enough where it&#8217;s long, that long funnel of people that make things, you know, whether the developer, designer, their marketing stuff, whatever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so that was, yeah, I think that&#8217;s the best way to have people subscribe is, you know, they can get it all. But they can look at the three channels too. So if they go on their pod thing and look for open web conversations, that&#8217;s primarily what they&#8217;re interested in. What we&#8217;re talking about there, they can subscribe to that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:04] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Just from a, well, it&#8217;s not particularly technical, but from a slightly technical point of view, how do you manage that? If memory serves you&#8217;re using Castos, which is a sort of self-hosted, it&#8217;s a WordPress plugin, which binds your RSS feed into your WordPress website, but also carries the functionality to have different series and episodes all within the same WordPress website. I might have been kind of promoting that a bit, and it&#8217;s not the solution that you used, but I think it is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:29] <strong>Bob Dunn:</strong> Yeah, it is. And so what it allows you to do, I could have actually created feeds for each series, but then I thought, is that going too granular? I mean, are you looking at all this stuff and thinking, so Open Web channel is like the default channel, I mean, openchannels.fm. Then you create three feeds for three shows or channels, which are the other three. And then when I do a series, I just choose to put it under whichever channel it should fall under.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:01] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Right, okay. So you&#8217;ve basically got three places to go and update, and you can handle all of that in the WordPress admin and what have you. I should probably say that there&#8217;s a SaaS equivalent as well. You don&#8217;t have to use WordPress to make that happen, but it&#8217;s so tightly integrated with WordPress, it kind of makes sense.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other curious thing about it though is that for the longest time we were really familiar with you as a real significant piece of that jigsaw puzzle. You know, Bob would do the episodes. It is always Bob, in the same way that there&#8217;s always me on this. But with this, I think you said now you&#8217;re up to, did you say 25 or 15 co-hosts, something?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:36] <strong>Bob Dunn:</strong> 25-30 hosts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:38] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay, that&#8217;s a lot. So you&#8217;ve got 25 other people who are helping you create the content. In effect, they have become you for these shows. They are the host, if you like, and they&#8217;re then interviewing people, and talking about whatever that episode may be about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How are you coping with that? How are you coping with no longer being behind the mic? And you&#8217;ve basically become a bit of a manager for a podcast network, which is curious.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:59] <strong>Bob Dunn:</strong> Yeah. Yeah, I&#8217;d like to, you know, I was talking to somebody about this and to me it was, it ended up being a goal that I didn&#8217;t know I wanted it to be a goal. You know, as I started to step back, I thought, well, you know, I&#8217;ve talked a lot over the years, I mean, more than anybody ever wanted to hear. I thought, well, maybe, you know, it&#8217;s time to get some other voices out there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the time being, I&#8217;m still doing the opening, but I keep myself as forefront as, I guess you call founder or whatever, of the podcast channel. And I&#8217;m cool with it. I love hearing the different opinions. It just was a shift for me at some point where I had no problem with it. And I think testing it in the beginning, I think the first three, so I brought on Brad Williams at the very beginning, because I didn&#8217;t want to do it by myself. We were just doing co-hosts and then we continued for a while.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then I brought on, later on I brought on Mendel Kurland, which at the time was GoDaddy, and Jonathan Wold who at the time, he was at WooCommerce, and now he has his own thing going on. And I would still be part of it, so it was the four of us. But I started liking the idea when I wasn&#8217;t part of it. It was fun to see somebody else take and run with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so over that period of years, I became more and more confident with people. Now, it&#8217;s basically, unless I have an idea for a guest, a lot of them choose our guests. They choose a topic because they&#8217;ve done this long enough. They know what I like to hear. They know what not to do and to do. I keep it pretty open for them. And they love that freedom because they don&#8217;t have to, you know, they come in, they do the recording, all the production stuff is not their responsibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think it&#8217;s also helped them to get to know each other more. They&#8217;ve gotten to know other guests. It&#8217;s built their brands some, I hope. And it became a point where I was just like, I thought this is it, this just works. And I&#8217;ve been really lucky with the hosts I&#8217;ve had, because they&#8217;ve been excellent. I never have problems. I mean, it just is a nice flow and they&#8217;ve all become good friends and, yeah, it works.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:17] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, I think if you were looking at it from the outside, there are so many trip wires there where you think, well, that, couldn&#8217;t work. You know, 25 hosts, multiple shows, yeah, okay. Good luck with that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But obviously, the history that you&#8217;ve got doing the shows and turning up to WordPress events, presumably you kind of knew most of these people fairly well already, so you had that rapport and trust with each other.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it&#8217;s a lot to trust them to just get on with it. To be able to say, okay, here&#8217;s the time slot, go off, get your guests and then just hand me the recording at the end, I&#8217;ve got complete trust in you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it does sound like you&#8217;ve still got your fingers in there a little bit with the kind of like the post-production and the editing, and finally making the episode into what it is and all of that, and shipping it. Do you ever see yourself stepping out to the point where you don&#8217;t even do that, where it&#8217;s just, there&#8217;s just this network?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:05] <strong>Bob Dunn:</strong> You know, I&#8217;d really like to kind of just have the role as founder. I mean, I&#8217;ve done a production and I&#8217;ve done this for, when we ran our other business before WordPress, the life and WordPress and stuff, we basically did everything, we didn&#8217;t have employees. So I&#8217;ve been doing this like over three decades.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, I am at a point where, no, I think it&#8217;s time to step back from some of this production stuff. I would like to because it, yeah, it buries you. And when it picks up and you have quite a few shows in a row or something, there&#8217;s some serious work to do. And I get a little too over picky with editing, probably somebody could do it a lot quicker. I mean, I, it drives me nuts sometimes. I&#8217;m thinking, why am I spending this much time on it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, yeah, I definitely am looking at some ways of doing that over the next few months. And looking at some other opportunities, but want to still be part of this, because it&#8217;s still my baby.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:00] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, I think that&#8217;s incredible to have that level of trust. I&#8217;ve never yet managed to have that relationship where I thought that I wanted to step away. I think for me, the bit that I enjoy more than anything else is this bit that we&#8217;re doing now, the bit I&#8217;m having a chat with somebody. I really do like the one to one, or one to few. So the most I do is 2, 3, 4 really is the sort of ceiling, and that&#8217;s the bit that I like most.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so the bit that you&#8217;ve stepped into, curiously, would be something that I would not really wish to be involved in. I&#8217;d rather just hand that off to somebody, but I do know what you mean.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You have a perfectionist approach to the editing, and you can be halfway through it and think, I&#8217;ve just spent six hours and all I&#8217;ve done is remove empty space that nobody would&#8217;ve noticed. Anyway, it can be curious.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So are you still iterating? Are you still willing to take on some new voices? Are you still open to people approaching you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:57] <strong>Bob Dunn:</strong> Yeah, we are. Because I think with this new brand, it&#8217;s kind of, before I get into that, I was just going to mention is that when you rebrand, I&#8217;m finding there&#8217;s a ton of work with post rebranding, and another one of my picky little, I don&#8217;t know what you want to call it, is I started looking at the site and I thought, well, I want this site to reflect the new brand a hundred percent. I don&#8217;t want people to go back and get confused.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve been changing the featured images on 670 episodes with the new brand. And, you know, that&#8217;s just, again, that&#8217;s me. But I want, it was quite a shift in rebranding and I want to make sure that, when they even go back, they see that, yes, I&#8217;m still on the same podcast, you know, I&#8217;m still on the same site so. Now I&#8217;ve lost track of what you asked.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:45] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> No, it&#8217;s okay. I&#8217;m actually going to pivot and just ask you a quick technical question, which is, did you close down your previous RSS feed, and rely on people finding the new one, or is there some clever way of moving people over?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:58] <strong>Bob Dunn:</strong> Yeah, you have to redirect it basically. It&#8217;s not a lot of steps, but it&#8217;s steps that if you don&#8217;t do it in the right order, it can really pretty much screw up everything. And right now, I am having a bit of challenge with some of the stuff moving over on Apple and the feeds and stuff, and I just put in a support question with them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But you basically, eventually I&#8217;ll shut down a show called Content Sparks and Do The Woo. Because they were, they&#8217;re now under Open Makers as a series, but I kind of got to make sure all the things are connected and working smoothly. So it&#8217;s something, if anybody ever does this, whoever&#8217;s hosting your podcast, talk to them and ask them questions until you feel confident to be able to do steps one through five, without blowing up your whole podcast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:43] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, it&#8217;s a bit like when you move a website, there&#8217;s loads of different bits and pieces that you&#8217;ve got to get right and in the correct order so that, I don&#8217;t know, your email carries on sending, and all the posts that you desperately want to be still in the search engine results, that kind of thing. Yeah, there&#8217;s a lot of hoops to jump through.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, so much so that a few kind of pivot ideas that I&#8217;ve had, not around WP Tavern, but around other podcasts that I do, I&#8217;ve kind of backed away just because the technical challenge was just not worth the time investment for the minor thing that I wanted to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyway, the question, returning to where we got to. The question was, are you still open to modifying what you do or have you solidified for a little period of time? In other words, if somebody catches sight of your podcast or listens to this one and thinks, do you know what I could contribute? I&#8217;ve got an idea in the open space that I would like to contribute. Are you still open to new hosts or is it really just guests now? Have you solidified on the hosts? Where are you at with all that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:36] <strong>Bob Dunn:</strong> You know, the hosts, I think the hosts that are on it right now, they always have the option. I mean, they volunteer their time. I&#8217;m hoping they get rewarded by, you know, brand and exposure. And I know a lot of them have met a lot of people and built relationships that they never would&#8217;ve been able to because they actually talked with someone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s another reason this particular structure of it now is so great because it&#8217;s so fluid. So it&#8217;s easy. If somebody comes in and has an idea, and it kind of gels and I think, okay, this is great, or maybe it exists with an idea I already have going or a series I do. Yeah, I&#8217;m always open to that because, you know, and some people kind of serve as, I don&#8217;t want to say substitute hosts, but they&#8217;re kind of there if I need to grab somebody, or I have an idea and it&#8217;s like, I need somebody to host this and this person would be good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, yeah, kind of a long answer there, but I&#8217;m always open, because this is not, this is a reason to change this is to keep it fluid and make it sustainable basically, where it can continue to grow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:42] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So definitely not closed, but you&#8217;re happy with where things are at the moment. If the status quo was to continue, that would be great. But, you know, new voices is possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, not just with the personnel, are you kind of fairly happy with the structure that you&#8217;ve got, the three channels that you&#8217;ve got now? Have you solidified more? Because it sounds like there&#8217;s, you know, been a couple of months of chopping and changing over there. Do you think you&#8217;ll stick with what you&#8217;ve got?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:02] <strong>Bob Dunn:</strong> Yeah, I think that&#8217;s definitely, it&#8217;s where it is because, like I said, I did something completely different in the rebrand in June, and since then I did something different again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think what happens is, when you rebrand and you start restructuring, what you thought was the right structure, you start looking at it and you think, oh, maybe this isn&#8217;t quite right. Maybe I should do it this way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I talked to several people. Getting some opinions, it&#8217;s nice because sometimes I&#8217;m inside my own head and it&#8217;s like, I need somebody to tell me if I&#8217;m just stupid or it&#8217;s a wild idea or, yeah, this is good. So, yeah, I like the three structured channels because it gives me so much flexibility under those.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:45] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I think it&#8217;s pretty remarkable what you&#8217;ve managed to do. You know, you went from just many, many, many years ago, just beginning a podcast. And just hacking away at that for years and years and years. And now you&#8217;ve got this, kind of like little mini network.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But also, I&#8217;m getting the intuition, I could be wrong about this, but I get the intuition that you&#8217;ve leaned into the word open so that you are no longer limited to just WordPress as a project. Is that the case? Are you going to be leaning into just other open source things, whether that&#8217;s other CMSs or, I don&#8217;t know, anything in the open source space? Is that in fact the case?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:19] <strong>Bob Dunn:</strong> Yeah, you know, I think what it is, in fact I was just talking to somebody, person that does accessibility, she wants to bring on somebody from Joomla and talk about accessibility because she&#8217;s under the open source channel. And exactly that. The impact of open source has been so huge and WordPress has been at the core of it. And WordPress will still be a big part of this podcast or this channels. And, yeah, I feel it&#8217;s healthy for my hosts. It&#8217;s healthy for everybody that listens, and everybody in the WordPress to hear about other stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, it just opens your mind. It has you thinking more about things and knowing what&#8217;s out there. And sometimes maybe you think, well, you know, I&#8217;m burned out on WordPress, but you hear some other stuff and you think, well, maybe it&#8217;s not so bad. You get a big picture of the open source and open web.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:11] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> There&#8217;s certainly no shortage of things to talk about if you go into open. I mean, obviously WordPress is such a large niche that you really can talk about that until the cows come home. But the you prize open the can of open source, you know, you really are a hundred x&#8217;ing the amount of things that you can talk about. So that&#8217;s kind of really nice that you can, well, you&#8217;ve basically got an infinite horizon of content to make in the near and distant future. And I don&#8217;t suppose open source is going anywhere in the short, medium, or long term. It&#8217;ll still be around.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, speaking of short, medium, and long term, if you&#8217;ve taken yourself away from the mic on every occasion to being in a few, and then kind of now being in the minority of things, and we talked about how you enjoy kind of managing the whole thing, even though it sounds like there&#8217;s a lot of shepherding cats, let&#8217;s put it that way, in the background.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is the intention for you to sort of get to the point where you can be invisible in this, well, certainly from a public facing point of view. You wouldn&#8217;t have your voice in any of them at some point, and you would be able to, I guess, silently kind of move away. Is this like an end game here? What&#8217;s going on?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:14] <strong>Bob Dunn:</strong> No, you know, I think I&#8217;m going to be involved, and the thing was built on my brand really. And I need to stay and keep my fingers in whatever way works for me. And, you know, I&#8217;m, I just turned 68, and I&#8217;m ready to do other things every once in a while like sit on a rock on the beach and look the water. You know, important things like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But no, it&#8217;s, I like looking at it as still being the face of it, but maybe, can I say not so much the voice of it? I&#8217;m out there, I&#8217;m still, you know, a huge part of it, and probably as long as I have my fingers in it, I&#8217;ll occasionally do little short podcasts. Right now, I do some on the updates on the site and, you know, I might even whip up something like, you know, thoughts from the founder, I don&#8217;t know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:03] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Oh, I like it, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:05] <strong>Bob Dunn:</strong> Yeah, something like that. So there&#8217;s, I don&#8217;t want to just become invisible because it really, how a lot of people have known this, and how I&#8217;ve built it is through my personal brand, and I think that&#8217;s important to stay intact with it. So I&#8217;m not going away anytime soon. And yeah, just need to reevaluate how many hours I put into it and how I can make it, again, more productive and sustainable. Because, you know, if I&#8217;m sick, who&#8217;s to do the production?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:33] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. When it was just you, you could just say, well, I&#8217;m not to record that one. I&#8217;ll just skip a week. But now that you&#8217;ve got like these 25 other hosts, you&#8217;ve got to kind of manage all of that. Oh, that&#8217;s really interesting. And of course, you&#8217;ve got to put time in the calendar to sit on the rock on the beach as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:47] <strong>Bob Dunn:</strong> Yeah, I know. I&#8217;ve got to get that in there, you know. It&#8217;s very important.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:52] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> How does this whole thing hang together from a financial point of view then? So is it a sponsorship relationship? Do you onboard sponsors to keep the whole thing, because obviously, you know, it&#8217;s trying to, you&#8217;re trying to support yourself in all of this. How does that work?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:03] <strong>Bob Dunn:</strong> Yeah, it&#8217;s basically sponsorship. And the sponsorship model, but ever since I started this podcast, in fact, before I started this one and did another one before that, I started having sponsors right away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if your podcast is your main source of income, you got to have something. So yeah, it&#8217;s sponsorships. I am sure you relate to it yourself. And, you know, unless you&#8217;re famous and they just roll in, or you can get like a million subscribers paying $5 a month or something like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, yeah, we&#8217;re constantly looking for sponsors. And I&#8217;ve changed the model so many times over the years. And it&#8217;ll probably change a little bit here again soon. So it&#8217;s never capped at a certain number. That might be capped for a period of time. But, yeah, it&#8217;s a constant flex and it&#8217;s hard work. And that&#8217;s all I can say.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:57] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, I will just drop the URL for that. So if you&#8217;re interested from this conversation, if you&#8217;re interested in getting on as a sponsor for the openchannels.fm network, it&#8217;s the regular URL, openchannels.fm, but then append to the end of that, /sponsors, plural, or you can just find it in the main menu at the top of the site. That will also get you there and, yeah, you&#8217;ll be able to find out more about how you might make the journey into sponsoring that podcast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, Bob, I know that you are a busy man. You&#8217;ve got 25 cohosts to shepherd and lots of editing to do, and dare I say it, sitting on a rock on the beach is also going to feature at some point during the day as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So thank you so much for chatting to me today. Once more, if you want to check out what Bob is doing with all of his co-hosts and his new structure, go to openchannels.fm to find out more. Bob Dunn, thank you so much for chatting to me today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:47] <strong>Bob Dunn:</strong> Thank you. Always a pleasure.</p>\n</div></details>\n\n\n\n<p>On the podcast today we have <a href=\"https://x.com/bobwp\">Bob Dunn</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bob is a long-standing figure in the WordPress community, having branded himself as BobWP back in 2010. With nearly two decades of experience in WordPress, Bob has become one of the most recognisable voices in WordPress podcasting, producing shows that have educated, inspired, and connected countless developers, builders, and enthusiasts. Most recently, he’s launched Open Channels FM, a rebrand and expansion from his well-known “Do the Woo” podcast, which was originally focused on WooCommerce but now explores broader topics around the open web, open source, and the wider maker community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bob talks about his journey in podcasting, from running Do the Woo for almost seven years, to the decision to rebrand and launch Open Channels FM. He explains why he felt it was time to broaden the focus, welcoming listeners from outside of just the WooCommerce and WordPress ecosystem, and how that led to a network approach with multiple channels and series.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bob describes how Open Channels is structured. Rather than traditional shows, the ‘network’ features three flexible channels, Open Makers, Open Source Reach, and Open Web Conversations, each hosting a variety of series. This lets content stay organised and evergreen, and accommodates the 25 to 30 rotating hosts with the freedom to produce series across different topics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bob talks about the challenges and rewards of handing over the mic, stepping into more of a managerial and founder role, and how he’s building a sustainable, collaborative podcasting network.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We discuss Bob’s technical approach as well, including how he uses WordPress to manage multiple RSS feeds and subscriptions, making it easy for listeners to follow specific channels, or get the firehose of all content.

In addition to all of the education that takes place at WordCamps, these are the main opportunities that committers (the folks who make the decisions on what code is ready to be shipped with WordPress) have to get to know each other and chat about ideas we have.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This year I&#8217;m serving as one of the leads for the Core Table at Contributor Day. It&#8217;s been a few years since I&#8217;ve been a lead on contributor day, and I&#8217;m excited at the prospect of helping new folks contribute for the first time while also helping existing contributors have an impact on WordPress. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m also organizing the (largely informal) conversation amongst Committers and the (just barely more formal) security team&#8217;s in person meeting. These are teams that work together throughout the year and being able to take some time to meet each other in person is always a great experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As an independently sponsored contributor to Open Source, I don&#8217;t have a company paying for my hotel or flight. While I did apply for the <a href=\"https://us.wordcamp.org/2025/apply-for-the-open-horizons-scholarship-to-attend-wordcamp-us/\">Open Horizons Scholarship</a>, I was unfortunately turned down. This means that essentially all of my sponsorship money for August will be going towards my attendance. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have added <a href=\"https://github.com/sponsors/aaronjorbin?frequency=one-time&amp;sponsor=aaronjorbin\">some one-off tiers of sponsorship</a> focused on WordCamp US 2025. There is also a free form for you to sponsor any amount you feel comfortable with or <a href=\"https://aaron.jorb.in/get-in-touch/\">get in touch</a> if you have another way you want to support me. If there are any organizations looking to help support an independent voice inside of WordPress, please consider sponsoring my attendance at WordCamp US. </p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://aaron.jorb.in/sponsor-a-wordpress-core-committer-at-wordcamp-us/\">Sponsor a WordPress Core Committer at WordCamp US</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://aaron.jorb.in\">Aaron Jorbin</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 12 Aug 2025 16:11:02 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6:\"jorbin\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:47;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:21:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:82:\"Open Channels FM: Open Channels FM, the Channels, the Series: Rebranding Phase Two\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:33:\"https://openchannels.fm/?p=105774\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:86:\"https://openchannels.fm/open-channels-fm-the-channels-the-series-rebranding-phase-two/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:302:\"In a recent episode, founder BobWP gave you an idea of where we are going with in Phase 2 of our rebranding.
